- Qualification
- Experience
- Gender

#### **Feature Engineering Decision:**
```python
# Original features: 6
features_original = ['name', 'age', 'address', 'qualification', 'experience', 'gender']

# Selected features: 2 (based on domain expertise)
features_selected = ['qualification', 'experience']

# Reasoning: These two features have strongest correlation with salary
```

### 4. Data Splitting Strategies

#### **Two-Way Split: Train-Test**
```python
# Classical ML approach
train_data = 70-80%  # Model training
test_data = 20-30%   # Performance evaluation
```

#### **Three-Way Split: Train-Validation-Test**
```python
# Advanced ML approach
train_data = 60%      # Model training
validation_data = 20% # Model validation and tuning
test_data = 20%       # Final performance evaluation
```

#### **Purpose of Each Split:**
- **Training**: Model learns patterns from input-output pairs
- **Validation**: Hyperparameter tuning and model selection
- **Testing**: Unbiased performance evaluation on unseen data
