Unknown: Okay, so welcome about everyone for the wonderful
journey of you know. AIML,
25 Okay, so let me introduce myself, myself. Dr Habib, you
can just say. Dr Habib, that's enough. Okay,
briefly about me. I did my PhD in artificial intelligence, and
I'm a certified instructor from Carnegie Mellon University in
robotics, and I published around 10 research papers. And
presently I'm working as a principal, a architect and US
based company
AI with cyber security.
Apart from that, I'm collaborated with talent sprint.
I got around 20 from past 20 cohorts and teaching AIML for
talent print, okay. And
presently, there are five students from Golden Gate
University. They are doing PhD under me. So I am the supervisor
for those five people. And those five people are like, you know,
one is into business domain, and second, into health sector, into
manufacturing, like the different domains they are doing
their PhDs. They are at a level of CX level. So presently they
are establishing their own company, and some people that
already from you know, they are working as a CTOs and CEOs. So
this is about me, and brief about this session unit one
generally, will try to understand the terminology of
AIML completely. And maybe in the beginning, you will feel
like people who is already having some domain knowledge of
AI and ML. You may feel that, okay, he's digging, you know,
basics of concepts. But to make everybody under the same page,
we are going to take each and every concept in depth. That
means, basically, we'll start with the basic understanding of
what is AIML, machine learning and all those things. Okay? And
one more thing to take up the questions, as we have a cohort
of around 200 plus. So generally, what we do is every
after an hour, I'm going to give you 15 minutes of time. So then
you can start putting your questions. Okay, so no need to
get panic or anything. Everybody have a chance of putting their
questions.
And for example, you can just raise your hand and
post will on YouTube, and then, according to the sequence, I'm
going to take up the questions.
Great.
And to save the bandwidth, I'll close my video. Is it okay?
Yes, okay, yeah.
Triple 80 faculty, yes. From triple it, I'm taking apart from
that. I am a Technical Lead. Okay, let's collaborate with
triple ID, so unit two, Unit Three. Also some like, you know,
whatever the technical sessions will be there. I'm going to jump
in. I'm going to take it like, for example, generate your
implementations will be there, past API deployment is there?
Like those things, okay.
Hope it is clear. Shall we start? Yes, yeah, okay,
great, so I'll just switch off my camera, but this is just
saving the bandwidth.
Okay, so now,
yeah.
So
is the screen visible to everyone?
Yes? Yes.
Okay,
great.
Just
Okay, so let me give an agenda of this class, what exactly we
are looking for
and what we are going to discuss, okay?
Today in the class, we are going to discuss about demystifying
machine learning. So they will try to discuss basically how
AIML works, okay, so what is an artificial intelligence and
machine learning by using some of the use cases in the first
part we'll discuss in the second part, we'll dig deeper, deeper.
Look at the ML. This is the first session. So the takeaway
of this session is you need to understand the terminology which
we are using in AIML. Going forward, you need two, Unit
Three, Unit Four also. So.
The same terminology will be used. So to make you acquainted
with those terminology, first unit is basically concentrating
more more on those kind of terminologies, and what kind of
classical machine learning? What is the maths behind that? And
I'm going to show you the black box behind how algorithm works
and all those things. Okay, so after an hour, I'm going to, you
know, give you a 15 minutes of time. Everybody, whatever the
questions you have, you can just unmute yourself, and you can
just start putting the questions, even in the chat box.
Also, you can put the questions. I'll take up the questions, and
I will answer all those questions. Okay, so let us start
the session first. Okay, so generally, we start with
various, you know, artificial intelligence. Nowadays, there is
a lot of you know, buzz about AI generative, AI agent, AI and all
those things, right? So let us see, first of all where AI is
starting. So in real world, where we are going to implement
our AI use cases. And for that, we start with the introduction.
Okay, so for example, when you first log into your Netflix
account, okay, they'll ask for select three kinds of general so
when you select, for example, you are selecting something
like, you know, action and trail, or sci fi or something.
So whenever you log in, according to your selection,
those movies will be popped up because there is a huge
collection of movies so that they cannot accommodate on a
single screen when you open your screen, right? So that is where
we are saying that okay, we need, instead of in traditional
programming, we need AIML. So this AIML understanding the
patterns, and then it is going to show you those things. So let
us jump in to the popular one, where actually AIML is now
started implementing. You might have seen an autonomous cars and
navigation, right? So one example we can take as a Tesla
Autopilot,
and second example you can say about a Waymo.
These are the two examples. So in autonomous car, like you
know, when it is on the road, what is happening, it is trying
to understand the road and looking at the different
signals, and it is understanding who is the pedestrian. And
according to that, it
is going to take a decision. So that is the first thing we are
starting with. You know, autonomous cars, they are
implemented with AIML, no, they are trying to understand the
pattern, and they are going to take a decision account into
that second. You might have seen, everybody knows, Alexa,
Siri, Cortana. So these are some of the, you know, the devices
where you can talk to them at their understanding your you
know the language, and they are going to give an answer for you.
So this is one use case where AIML is implemented in real
time. Both next one we have as the creativity generating an
images. For example, when we are giving a group of images and we
are saying that, okay, generate another similar kind of image
feature. This is one thing, another thing. You are at the
age of eight years. For example, we are giving in photograph when
you are at the age of eight, and you're asking AIML that, okay,
can you produce this after 10 years? How I look like? What
will be the features? Okay, how is my features and all those
things? Okay, there also, we can use an AIML next one playing
games against a human like suppose, if you want to be very
good proficient, instead of having an human competitor, we
are training a model, for example, an algorithm, or
whatever the program you have similar kind of intelligence. We
are keeping over there, and it is competing with the human
being. So that way you are trying to learn without a
support of a human being. And you are trying if you are
defeating that you know that
whatever the model you have, then you are better with others
right next one, if you did a little bit more deeper of, you
know, end to end driving. So the magic happens when it is looking
into the road and understanding the, you know, the you need to
take a left signal or the right signal, and how need to
approach, and what is the, you know, if any obstacle is there,
and all those things. So generally, what happens here?
It is going to take on street images, and from the street
image, street images, it is trying to extract some of the
important features, and that important features it is using
for driving. So then it is going to take that features and
understanding, you know, taking the decision in moving in a
right direction, or straight away, or left direction,
something like that. Okay, so what is the features and all
those things, terminology we are going to discuss.
Further. Okay. So now, if you compare with, you know,
traditional programming time with the AI and a simple slide,
we can say that data is the one which you are loading into
machine learning, Model and Model understanding, and it is
going to give us the function. So when you are giving a data to
any machine learning that may be a classical machine learning
algorithms are deep learning. Algorithms are generative, AI,
whatever it may be when you are giving a data to the model,
model is trying to understand the pattern from that so once
you understand the pattern. So whenever you give an unseen
data, it can say that, what is the next R we can do the
predictions. So as we here, I would like to give you a simple
example in details like technically I'll explain. So
before that, what are the areas which are flourishing in modern
AI. So we are talking about language. So we have nowadays,
NLP, natural language processing is there. Then we have a speech
processing, which is understand, understandable by AI. Then we
have a computer vision by taking with the camera. We are trying
to understand the there are obstacles and their behavior and
all those things. Then we have a robotics which is mimicking the
human behavior, like, like whatever we do. The similar kind
of intelligence has been kept into robotics. So these are the
fields which are flourishing a lot in the modern AI. So if you
look into the simplified view of any you know, machine learning
model, for example, if you look into this problem statement,
when I say 13579,
what will be the next number? So, like generally, when you
look into the pattern, immediately, you can say that,
Habib. Okay, so there is difference between first and
second. Number is two and two like that. So nine plus one two
will be 11. Okay, well and good. So here what you are trying to
do. You are trying to predict what will be the next number
correct
how it is implemented in traditional programming. Are in
AIML, okay, let us take that example in detail, so you get a
complete idea of how AIML works.
Okay, let us keep this in this way,
we have something like 0123,
and four. This is why we have one, three by seven and nine.
Okay, good. Now,
if I ask you for five, what is the answer? So generally, you
can see when you see this 13579,
when we say the question mark, what is the answer? You will say
it is a 11, correct.
Okay, well and good. But now if I ask you, give me a generalized
function. So whenever I put this x value, it must return the
actual value. So we can say that, okay, you can take a
function, something like f of x is equal to something 2x plus
one, correct. Now, instead of x, if you put zero, then you are
going to get the first value. When you put one, you are going
to get the second value. Like this. If I ask you, can you
write, can you build a traditional program without
machine learning? So already you're aware of Python, right?
So let us say definition.
If you write predict some x value, what you are going to
return, you are going to return two times of x plus one. This is
a simple function correct graphically, if you want to
visualize this in traditional programming, how things will
work now. So here x is the
input
and set of instructions. I can say this is a program
correct so we have an input and the program. Then when you are
using these two together, what you are getting, you're getting
a output correct. So precisely we can say that input plus a
program
which is going to give us
an output. This is happening in traditional programming, correct
now,
graphically, our visualization, if you are convert that into
visual, visual format, we can say that, okay, for example, I'm
keeping this program on.
Any machine. That machine consists of CPU and arithmetic
logic unit and all those things. So let us think like a PC. So
what is the input going in? First of all input, then we are
going to have a program.
Then it is going to generate an output. So if you visualize a
traditional programming, this is the traditional programming.
Okay, well and good. So we have,
you have written a program that is definition, predict something
then, which is going to return something that may be C, C Plus
Plus Pascal or anything. Now, when you give an input as a five
to this program, program is taking the five and two times of
five plus one is 11, so output will be 11. This is happening in
traditional program. Now coming to the artificial intelligence.
That means AIML program, how it works. Okay, so what is the
basically, the difference in AIML and compared to the
traditional programming. Let us put it in this way, so we have x
as 01234,
and why? 13579,
so nine,
okay, so here, x is the input, y is the output. So what is the
data? Now, data will be the combination of input plus an
output. We call this as a data. Now, if you look into the slide
which I discussed here, the one which I discussed
here, so data getting into the machine learning model, then it
is understanding correct. So that means, if you say data is
getting into any model. For example, we have different kinds
of machine learning algorithms. Let me take one algorithm. For
example, I'm taking linear regression algorithm, so then it
is going to generate a output. Now, output will be a generic
format, so it is going to give us the function something like
2x plus one.
Previously, if you compare with traditional programming, who is
writing this 2x plus one? We are the human beings. We are writing
2x plus one by understanding the pattern, but now coming to AIML.
AIML is writing the pattern that is f of x is equal to x plus
one, correct. So more in depth. If you're writing this similar
to the traditional programming, we can say that input
and output
getting into any model. So for example, linear regression and
what is generated? Function is generated. What is the function
here, 2x plus one. So input will be x, output will be y, and this
is generated. If you compare with the traditional programming
here, we have an input, then we have a program, and then the
output. So if you translate this into ml problem, what we are
going to do. We are going to give an input value as well as
an output value, which is, in our terminology, known as a
data. So the combination of input and output, we call it as
a data. Now that data we are injecting into the linear
regression model and the model is producing a function. So once
you get this function, I will deploy this into a cloud
platform. For example, I can deploy into the Azure platform,
or GCP platform or AWS platform. People can use this as a, you
know, the model, and they'll give an input, and they'll get
the answer. For example, let's put it in a real time
perspective. Some of the one of the doctor approached you, you
said, they said that. Okay, you did. AIML, course, and you are
good at, you know, writing a mail algorithms. My problem
statement is,
I want to predict whether the person is prone to diabetic or
not. So then you will ask him, do you have any historical data
for him? Right? For example, do you have a patient data? So then
he said that, yes, I do have some patient data. So I'm going
to take some of the features, like I'm going to look into his
BMI, insulin, skin thickness, something like that. Then I'm
going to predict whether the person is prone to diabetic or
not, this is what can you build a model for me. So then when the
problem statement comes in, remember, generally, in machine
learning, we are going to look into three points. Okay, first
thing is, we'll see. Is there any pattern existing?
So I'm talking about classical machine learning. I'm not
talking about generative AI, okay, so first, let us start
with the classical machine learning models. So where I'm
asking about, do you have any pattern? So he says that yes, we
have a pattern. What is the pattern? If the skin thickness
is high and the body consists of more insulin, the person is
prone to diabetic for example, doctor, subject matter expert.
He said, Okay, well and good. The part is existing. Second one
is it previously, did you implement it using any, you
know, mathematical
implementation, for example, like, similar to 2x plus one? He
said that, okay, it is, I implemented some mathematical
but it is not up to the mark. We need to enhance that. Third and
foremost thing we are asking is the Do you have a data? Which
data, historical data? So if three things are given to you,
you can say, okay, good to go. I can implement an algorithm for
you. So you can use that algorithm to predict
whether the person is prone to diabetic or not. But now,
previously, data is one of the important thing if you want to
write machine learning algorithm. But nowadays, thanks
to the community, generate a community, and remaining deep
learning community that we can generate a synthetic data. That
means, if a subject matter expert give us a sample data,
using the sample data, we can generate a synthetic data, and
we can build the model. Now, if you take the same problem
statement in the above, what we discussed here, for example,
here we discussed, right? So what is that we have an input
and output, we need to build a machine learning model, okay? So
you can see here, I did this data and linear regression
implementing I'm going to get a 2x plus one. So I'll do one
thing now for understanding already you have a Python
understanding, right? So I'll try to implement in the CoLab
notebook a simple algorithm. Don't need to worry about the
code part. Later on out, we are going to discuss about the code
part, I want you to understand basically how AIML look like.
Okay, so let me do one thing.
I'll open the CoLab notebook here.
After the CoLab notebook implementation, I'll take up the
questions. Okay, just little bit patience. I'll answer all the
questions.
Okay,
CS, 25
session one.
Let me share this notebook with you.
Okay.
Well, let me take we'll discuss all those models and all those
things in coming sessions, just for understanding.
In Python, you might have taken NumPy also, right? How to create
an array, okay, let us do one thing, x, x will be
NP, dot array of for example, I'm taking the input. What is
the input? Now, 01234,
is my input. Okay, so I need to convert that into column vector.
So I'll change that tree shape into negative, one, comma, one.
Now coming to Y. Why is the output? We can just say NP, dot,
array of
so what is the output? 1357,
and nine. We have these are the samples.
Okay, so now we write model is equal to linear regression.
Okay, to understand the pattern, we'll say model, dot, fate, xn,
y. So you can see this box is generated. Think like this box
is nothing but your model. So think in this way, what we did
now, we have generated this box that is a linear regression by
giving x and y, that means it got the pattern. So now you need
to produce the function Correct. You need to produce the
function.
So let me write down the function
here before.
At LR, dot predict when I predict, for example, five. What
is the for five? What is the answer?
Sorry, model is given right.
Model dot predict five. Output is we got it as a 11.
So here, if you understand when fit process what I'm going to
give. I'm giving X and Y. So it is as an input to the model.
Model is generated. Once the model is generated, we are
predicting file. So if you want to see the function, we can just
write down,
print,
model, dot,
model, coefficient
of zero,
then times of x plus
model dot intercept.
So we got the function right. So already it built a function
saying that 2x plus one. So from where we got this function from
the model. So here the output is, it is giving us the model
that is 2x plus one.
This is the model. So once you got the model, what we can do?
We can give this model access by using any cloud platform, or we
can use some of the tools to build the proof of concept. We
call it. We can use those things to make you like, you know,
utilization of those models. Okay,
okay, I'll stop here, because that's the first session. So let
us take up the questions. If you have any questions, please
raise your hand in the sequence,
please raise your hands then we can take up the questions you
Okay, go ahead, first. Saurabh, yes, sir. So the mathematical
function that we had the box will generate, right, depends
upon the data. Let's say I have a data like, let's say four
point exactly. It depends upon the data. Correct. You have a
value like X, 4.5 so that function that it returns 2x plus
one it it doesn't hold through there, right? So there will be
some other function so it all depends upon x, right? Exactly.
Data,
perfect.
Next question, Praveen, yeah, on that colab notebook, I'll just
have a reminder question, like the D shaped function, which we
use for that array, right? Like it's already one day, right? Oh,
sorry, prabin, I said don't worry about the coding part.
It's a 1d array and all those things. Okay? Because
technically, when we implement the algorithms at that time,
we'll discuss so just see how algorithm is working. Don't look
into because we didn't started with the code part, right? Okay,
we didn't discuss any coding, so just I am trying to make you
understand how AI works. So take up that, and when we write real
code, I'll explain each and every part why I did reshape and
everything. Okay, okay, so because see, a lot of huge crowd
is there, let us stick to the straight points only. Let us not
divert our concepts, okay?
Jay Paul,
yes, sir, this model you created, right? This is
particular to this one only, right? This data,
so if we change data, so then that will no one work, right? So
we have to create another model. Exactly.
Yeah, got it good. Sahil,
hi, Aimee. The question that I had was, you choose Linear
regression algorithm? Is it based on the type of problem? We
keep changing the algorithms? Or I was just curious about that
particular aspect here. Yeah, sure, sure. So I'll answer that
going forward in the next part. Definitely. According to the
problem statement, we use supervised learning,
unsupervised learning, or reinforcement learning. Again,
in the supervised learning, we have a regression problems and
classification. So here it's a regression problem we are going
to take up. Okay, we have that in the second part. Okay, we'll
discuss that. I had another question. Actually, you resized
X array, which is your input, but didn't, didn't do anything
for why is it something which is expected? Sahil, that's what I
said, right? Don't worry about the coding part. Just understand
the part of that coding part we'll discuss, because we didn't
jump into the writing algorithms, right? So my
intention in the first session is just to make you understand
the difference between a classical machine learning and
the AIML. So try to take up that. So later on, what we'll
take dig into each and every part. So the code will be it is
not like something you know, already written. I'm going to
take up and discuss online, live coding. I'll do it Okay, so each
and.
Report I will explain. Don't worry. Yeah, sure.
Vivek,
first, fast,
Okay, hello. Am I audible? Yeah, you're audible. Go ahead. Yeah,
yeah, hi. So you mentioned about synthetic data generation, you
know, just a moment back, right? So, how is it work? And you
know, even after the data generation, are we gonna do
like, you know, the data, just give me a minute. Don't worry
about the synthetic data when we real time implementation. At
that time we are going to discuss, okay, okay, so today's
session is just try to understand terminology and what
basically AIML works. Got it? Got it, yeah. Raghu, yeah. So
the question I have is that maybe you will cover it later.
But the thing is, you, are you? We know the data as input and
output. Is there anything in in AIML, where the data is like
chosen or curated, or, you know what, what is the inputs that we
take? I mean you, you gave an example of
Tesla, or way more the data inputs, and you also discussed
about the diabetes problem. So what are the inputs that needs
to be considered to consider this as a valid input and valid
output? How do you Yes? Yes, perfect. So Vivek, don't think
that is cutting in the middle of the question. Vivek, actually,
we'll discuss that in that separate part is the session in
unit two. We call it as a feature engineering. So what are
the inputs going to the model? Those things will be, you know,
discussed in detail when you're building a model, how things
will be decided. There you'll understand. What is the AIML
explainability. We call it, okay.
Okay, good to go. Okay. Ashok, once
you have one question, just, okay, lower your hands, yeah, go
ahead, yeah,
yeah. Actually, my question is, like,
in this model, we have given some set of data, right? So, I
mean, this is a predefined data, like, I mean, before giving,
right? So is there any massaging happens to the model
or the model, to the model happens through the data
preprocess, yeah, I'll show that what, how things will happen.
I'll show that all the roles and everything I'll discuss, okay?
And also have another question, like, I mean, it this data
generating some model, right? So there may be the error
percentage also, so So some data, exactly, right? Yeah,
we'll discuss that. Is there any way to check that? Yes, we'll do
that. We call it as a accuracy. We do that so we say model dot
score x and y. This is going to give 100% model accurate. Okay,
like this will find accuracy a simple problem. You get the
accuracy. Okay. Next question.
Thank you. Yeah, welcome Chaitanya.
What
are the
You Are Not Audible. Chaitanya,
sorry. Give me one minute, yeah,
meanwhile, I'll take the question with Hirak, yeah.
Please go ahead, yeah. My question is,
is it? So you printed
model coefficient into x plus model? Is it? Because I see that
this is the straight line from equation like y is equal to mx
plus c, right? It is actually linear regression. That's why,
always the format will be like this, yes, yes, it's a linear
regression. That is always the format. And if you have a
polynomial, how it works, all those things, when we take real
algorithms, you will understand, Okay, understood? Okay, yeah,
great. Which one?
So these are, these are like numerical values. Means, if we
take a real world values, like Apple or anything, so predict,
so what models will means, we'll use different models for,
yes, we'll use different models. Which one we'll discuss that
that is,
if you have a features, then if you have a text, if you have a
audio and video, those things we'll discuss in coming
sessions. Okay, so this today's session is just try to
understand how things work, like you know the difference between
traditional programming and AIML in detail of coding and what we
have to take all those things in coming session, in detail,
everything will be discussed. Okay,
sure. Thank you. Welcome mandri.
Hi. I think mine is like a collaboration of the questions
that have been asked, but please let me know if it's going to be
covered later. But so the
the accuracy is what I was more interested in. You just showed
that. You know it tells you.
This model is 100% etc. How does the model determine the
accuracy? Is it depending on the data, or is it at the time of
the designing of the model? Or is it like the data set that you
provide once the model is being utilized? I'm trying to
understand that part like, how did it reach to actually, as I
said in the beginning of the session, that today, we are
going to discuss about only the terminology and the basic
understanding of how AIML works. Okay, so going forward, we are
going to discuss about like, what is future engineering? What
is an accuracy? What is precision recall? It is from the
data, or it is from the model, what you are using? How do you
refine it? How do you, you know, model, you know, increase the
accuracy and all those things. Okay, so today just don't we
take it wrong, because we have every session have their own
goals. So today's session goal is just understanding the
terminology and understand the basic difference between a
traditional programming and the machine learning. So the next
session will be something else and deeper, like the step by
step will go on. Okay, so we'll answer all the questions. We'll
take up everything. Okay, okay, sounds good. Thank you. Yeah.
Kishore, please go ahead.
Yeah. So part of the question is already answered. Like I had the
same question, like, when we use a linear regression, it should
always be like, mx plus c, or anything else will also come,
that was my question. Yeah. Polynomial comes in sometimes 2x
square plus one, something like that, yeah, according to the
problem statement, sure. Raghavendra,
so this is for ml, right? So how would it be for an AI program?
Yes, will be all raghuvendra. Raghuvendra, ML and AI Bucha are
different.
Ai, one of the sub part of AI is ml, okay, and if it is a text,
we are going to use algorithms which we convert the text into
numerical values, then we apply classical whereas the generative
AI, we call it as embeddings. We do it so those things where
you're taking a text, we'll discuss. Okay, yeah,
okay, good. Next one. Prabhaka,
yeah,
I
You mentioned about classical
machine learning, and then AI machine learning. So what is
classical machine learning? Is it the traditional way of
finding solutions? So, no, no, no, I say, I didn't say AIML or
something. Classical machine learning in the sense we are
going to use some of the algorithms which do the
predictions. Then, after the classical we get deep learning,
then we'll get the Generate AI. I'll put that. I'll explain
that. Sindhu, okay. I'll give you a moment after taking up the
question. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Prabhakar, please.
Once you have done with your question, please lower your
hand.
Yep, go ahead.
Sindhu, I think, yeah. So my question is like, I'm just
trying to understand, when exactly should we start thinking
ml, like the problem that you presented. We could do both
traditional and ml. So when can we start thinking like, Okay,
for this problem, I should think ml way, like, is it options or
like, what exactly is definitely, I'll answer that.
Sindhu, okay, after these questions, I'll answer that.
Okay. Next one. Chaitanya, go ahead. I think you missed. You
were unable to hear yes. Hopefully I am audible. So,
yeah, perfectly audible. Chaitanya, yeah, thank you.
Model. Dot predict and operating this model that predict, okay,
we'll dig deeper later. But predict is a function. It is for
every model a predict function is there. So when we are
creating an object of model, we can access all the functions. So
in Python, object oriented programming, you might have
discussed, right? How do we access the functions? So I'm
creating an object of linear regression. And linear
regression have different models. Are like, you know,
score? Is there predict? Is there those function I'm trying
to access? Clear,
yeah. Next question, please.
Hi. We were
talking about the traditional programming, and you also
explained about the model right when it's created in traditional
programming, you said there will be an input and there'll be a
program which will process the and then you will get the
output. But in this model, basically you're giving an input
and output, and it'll give you a function, right? Exactly,
exactly here, in line number let me you already know the linear
regression is mx plus c, and you put in line number five, you've
given efficient and all of that. But I was expecting this model
to give a function. We don't know what the function shape
would be, right? But yeah, no way. Ashby, no way. It is a
black box. So just to make you understand, this is given model
inbuilt is there only give the input, it will predict. So
nobody can till now, there is. It's a completely black box.
Model cannot print the function. Okay. It is just creating
coefficients and the intercept. It is combining itself inside,
okay. So.
Okay. So just to make you understand, in the first class,
I'm just printing in this way, I know that this is a linear
equation. Perfect, correct. Yeah, okay, okay, so you will
know the shape of the function as output of the linear
equation. I mean model in the later part, exactly. Okay, thank
you.
Yes. So deep Aman circle. Yeah, hi,
hi, doctor, we so my question is regarding the difference in the
traditional programming and the classical ml. So here in
traditional programming, you said that the output is
basically the so I just wanted to understand the output in
traditional program. Is it the value by Visa V the output in
can be anything output. It can be value, or it can be anything.
For example, in traditional programming, I have given an
height and weight. I said, predict the gender. So what you
are going to do if you are writing a condition, if height
is greater than 80 and weight is greater than 70, generally, the
gender is male. If it is less, you say female, that combination
you writing correct. So those things will do by using ml. So
ML will understand that pattern. So whatever the conditional
statements you're writing, ml will take up and will do the job
for you understood. Okay, so we don't have to put any kind of
condition FL statement, which the
basically the mathematical models will do exactly Okay,
understood perfect Aish.
Then,
many a times we read that leader regression is a statistical
technique
going diving deep onto the linear regression. But I'm
curious about what is the term statistical technique imply
here,
statistical technique,
linear regression. Statistical technique is actually after the
data is spread. How the data is spread? Motor, will the model
will understand in that way? Okay, I'll give you that. Okay,
Vivek, what is the question?
Okay, thanks, yeah. Vivek, what is your question?
No, okay, people, what's your question? Go ahead, sir. There's
a there's a error in the pattern. Let's say, if we make
five or six, what happens then how, you know, model get to
know, like, you know, there's a anomaly, there's a problem in
there.
Model will not understand that people actually you will get a
incorrect answer. Then you need to fine tune the algorithms. So
instead of that, you have to use, for example, deep learning
models or generative AI. So going forward like that. Okay,
okay, you have a complex problems, sure. Thank you. Yeah.
Chakrapani, yeah. So sir, here you had only one input variable
and one output variable. In case of multiple input variables,
right? As your model predict always take linear regression,
and does it always give you an expression? No, it's not a
linear regression. Actually, a lot of models will come in. We
have a polynomial regression. Is there polyration? We call it
classification problems. Are there all those things? Okay, so
according to the problem statement, we have to apply so
those things will come with an experience. So generally, data
scientists job is to just make our programs hit and run, he
will see whichever is doing good algorithm, then he's going to
take it. Okay.
Okay, great. Okay, very good questions. Okay, so let us
answer all those things one more time, just I'll jump into the
chart.
One question is, how does it work when we give 1357, as an
output? Tarun, actually it is trying to understand, I'll show
you how things will work. Linear Regression is a inbuilt
function. No, it is actually linear regression is a class
from a scale and package skn is a Python package which consists
of all classical machine learning to algorithms together.
Think like it is a folder where we have all the files together.
Okay, coming to when multiple linear regression models are
available, like above, when sample data is given, how model
is picked up to get output. Okay? So that is totally Madhuri
depends upon you. For example, you can take a linear regression
then going forward, another technique is there. We call it
as a decision tree regressor. Is there, then we have a support
vector regressor. So if linear regression is not working, then
we are going to use another algorithm, which is a
mathematical intuition behind that is different. So that way
we try to predict the good answers. Okay,
for example, maths behind every algorithm is different. Perfect
Surabhi, so you understood well, every math algorithm have their
own mathematics. So for example, as a hobby I came up with,
actually, in 2004
I have worked with a linear regression. Actually, okay, so
when I worked with the linear regression, I published my first
paper. At the time, we thought of only the linear data. How the
data is, you know, scattered. But later onwards, we when we
are getting deeper into the machine learning algorithms.
Data is not only.
Uttered in linear format, something unlinear format also,
then we'll use another algorithm. Okay, so as a PhD,
what I will do, I'll come up with some new mathematical
intuition behind that, and if the algorithm goes well, that
will be published in SK, LAN, okay. Next question is, how can
you decide which model should apply as a per problem
statement? Okay, this is with experience Chakrapani. Perfect
answer that depends upon like, you know, once you get an answer
like you know, adequate with using all those things, for
example, how linear regression works and all those things
definitely, then, according to that, you are going to take a
decision whether this model is good or that model is good. And
another thing at the end, I will try to show you, nowadays,
working as a data scientist. Machine learning becoming very
easy. No need to write a code, no need to, you know, all those
things. But
like you know, what do you say?
We can use auto ml, we call it so that can be done. Okay,
don't worry. See Jagdish, little bit patience is needed. Post, so
don't worry, I'm going to answer all the complete concept will be
covered. Because some like, you know, if you're understanding
that is well and good, some people, they don't understand.
The mind will stuck at that position. It will not allow them
to understand. So in the first two session, sessions, please
bear with that, and we'll take the questions every topic. Okay,
don't worry. Now, let me explain you some of the things. What we
have a lot of questions, okay?
So generally,
I think after the questions, I understood, like, what,
what you are expecting, okay, so as a AI, artificial intelligence
is a broader spectrum. In AI, we have one of the sub topic is an
ML, then we have a deep learning, then we have a
generative AI. First of all, you need to understand the
differences in this. Then you will, okay,
sir, will be the scoring among yes model, yeah. Automl will do
the job. Not similar. Okay, that. Okay. Now, what is ml
actually AI. When the term AI started, it was not a new one.
In 1956 we started with the term AI Artificial Intelligence. At
the time, it didn't flourish, because everybody's thinking
that it is something you need to make a human eye. That's where
and it went into, you know, the shadows. And then after around
2000 time, they came up with the concept of a machine learning.
What is that? Machine learning? Machine learning is something
like as when you are jumping into the sessions of
mathematics, when you are in the third or fourth standard your
mathematics teachers comes in says that, okay, three plus four
is seven, five plus two is seven, five plus five is 10. Now
she will ask you the question, six and three is how much so she
is giving you how many examples like three examples she is
giving with the input and the output, input and the output
input and output. Now, whenever the new input is given your
she's asking you, what is the output? So same kind of
technique is implemented, and that is named it as a machine
learning, instead of human learning. Machine is learning.
So how it is learning? It is taking some sample data, then it
is generating a function. That function is going to produce the
answer for us, for example, in this case, what is the function
we are going to have? For example, f of x will be x1 plus
x2 just adding correct very simple. But the limitation came
in. It flourished around five years. Very good people. They
adopted it and they used it. But problem came in, when we have
not only numerical data, we have a textual data and unstructured
data. That means this ML is generally best for structured
data, for example, which is in relational data format. What
about unstructured and semi structured data? Say
unstructured and semi structured data, we are unable to use it.
So then the research came in, and they came up that, okay,
till now, we are mimicking how human beings being is learning
with an example. Then they thought that, okay, let us do
one thing. Let us implement in a way how human brain works. So
mimicking the human brain, that is the deep learning. So at the
time, the term neural networks came into picture. What is the
neural network? If you think of your human brain, in human
brain, there will be a neuron. When I ask you a question, if
you don't know the answer, this neuron will fire three neuron
more, again, three, three neurons. This way it fire and
will try to solve the complex problem. It is trying to search
from the memory and trying to with the previous understanding.
It is trying to give you the answers, okay, so that is deep
learning. So deep learning was able to solve the problems of
unstructured and semi structured. For example,
unstructured is images are there are some sound you have that is
unstructured coming to the semi structured is like an XML is
there? For example, you have a student.
And then we have an age is 25 close the age, something like
this. Our JSON format, these all semi structured, so DL was able
to handle all those things, and it can handle huge amount of the
data. Okay? So when DL came in, everybody is happy that now a
can solve classical problems and unstructured, structured, semi
structured problems. Also it was able to solve using deep
learning. Then, if you think of ml and DL, both are what they
are doing, ml and DL both are doing predictions.
Okay, so when you are giving some input, it is predicting.
When you are giving an input, it is predicting. Then they came up
with a language model. We call it,
okay, so language models are, they are not predicting. They
are generating content, generating content. So the name
is given as a Gen AI, because they are taking the data similar
to you, like you know, as a human being, we are trying when
the Okay, for example, when a book is given, Harry Potter,
book is given for you one of the part. And when I ask you
briefly, can you explain what exactly in the book you are
going to give it in, morally like, mostly three to four
sentences, correct? So the complete understanding you are
keeping into three to four sentences, that is your
comprehension, the language similar. Now, when I give you a
simple one line a question, I say that, can you elaborate more
on this? For example, what is a white ball in the cricket Can
you explain in what way they you know, conclude it is a white
ball or something like that? You are giving a paragraph or two
paragraph to explain me correct. So you're not giving any
prediction, whether it is a white ball or not. What you are
giving you are giving me an explanation. You are generating
a new content. So that is, we call it as a gene, a models now
coming to machine learning again. In the machine learning,
we are going to have different kinds of models that is known as
a supervised and unsupervised incoming we are going to discuss
those things. Okay, hope I have answered all the questions good
to go.
Just give you a thumb in the chat so that we can
Okay,
so one request is the one humble request for everyone. Don't get
panic that okay, we're spending time on the questions, because I
want everybody to know exactly before getting into the actual
sessions. So little bit patience and support will be very
helpful. Okay,
because people who is having little bit of knowledge, they
may feel that okay, little bit okay. Habib is taking up all
those questions only one or two sessions. Once these sessions
are completed, then everybody will be in the same room, and
you don't expect that kind of questions at the end only, we'll
take it okay. Can we relate generative tool that covers
entity of the document where s, exactly NLP falls into DL, yes,
actually, NLP. Siddha started with deep learning, but later
onwards, NLP is flourish in a way that not only limited to
English, different kinds of languages. And then the using of
that NLP concept, we created a generate that is, we call it as
a large language models and all those things, okay? Here One
example is, okay, 2x plus one function, for example. This is
the question, okay. Not only this is not this one is the
linear regression. People who is having little bit of
mathematical background, they think that, okay, this is the
simple linear regression. We know that. This is y is equal mx
plus c format you are putting it.
Algorithm can print the function. No way. Algorithm
cannot print a function. It is going to just give us the
coefficients only, okay. Now coming this question, 139, 1933,
what is the next number? We can say it is a 51 say, Okay, well
and good. Very simple, correct. If I ask you, what is the
function? You say, Happy. It is something around, you know, 2x
square plus one, okay, well and good. But coming to
like generally, how do we solve those kind of problems? So we
are trying to find the pattern from the examples, and then we
are creating a function. Once you create the function, we are
using the function to predict the next number, or we say that
it is a of that function is used to solve our problem, prediction
problem. This is what we did. So in our first example, when we
did a practical implementation, we came to know that the
function F of X from the model that is a 2x plus one. Once we
got this one, we use this function to predict the next
number. What is that number five? So when we keep this two
times of five plus one, we are able to get 11. So that is what
we did, correct. Okay, so how do you design this computational
procedure? Now, tell me we did this. Now you are good to go
with this slide. Very easy, right? So what is our data? Now,
data is 13579,
and 012301234,
this is the data. What is the algorithm I used here?
A linear regression. Then what is the function? It produced 2x
plus one correct. See how easy it for you, because when you see
practical implementation, and when you see the critical part,
understanding will be very easy. Now anybody can say that, okay,
we took the data, we injected into an algorithm. Algorithm,
understood the pattern, it is produced a function, and that
function I'm using for prediction, if there is no ml,
then we need to write our function correct. This is what
we are trying to do.
Now, okay, so for this question, also we know that this is the
next number. Is a 51 and the function is 2x squared plus one.
Now some people ask me if we miss some number. Ah, now in
this kind of problem, can you tell me what is the next number?
So up to this generally rule based programming, we can use
it, but when it comes to this question, we don't know what is
the next number and how it will be. So here the need of ml
arises. So when you have some complex problems and you cannot
use a rule based and you don't know what is the function to
generate, then we jump into rule based, sorry, in ML. I'll give
you very simple example so that you can you will take some
examples in the chat box. I am expecting for you people to
write the, you know, whether Shall we go with ml or, you
know, general rule programming. I'll take out that. For example,
consider this 2d point. Previously, we took one
dimensional way. Now if you have a two dimensional for example,
for one, we got 3x is one. What is the y we got 3x is two. What
is the why we got? Why is the 6x? Is 3y, is nine. What is the
function? Now tell me,
sorry.
So that means if x is one, three times of one, 3x is two, three
times of two. We are getting like that. So this is simple
problems. So by using rule base, you can say, so function will be
three times of x, correct. This is what we can do. So when will
be the difficulty and when do you need
uncertainty? Let us see.
So just now, we have taken an example where instead of 13579,
we got something 0.9
3.15 something like this. So we don't know the numbers are
uncertain, and sometimes there is a noise in measurement or
some missing value. So one of the participant asked me, how,
if there is after five, seven, we have, instead of 11, we have
13, so there is a missing number correct. So in that situation,
rule based programming doesn't work. So in that situation, it
makes very tough for us to use any normal programming that may
be Python or Java or something, and not only two dimensional,
sometimes you have a three dimensional numbers. Are there?
100 dimensional points are there? For example, if you have
an image, if you take an image, for example, image is, for
example, 200 by 200 pixel taking an image. So we have each and
every pixel like this. So 200 by 200 dimension image, I need to
take it, and then need to understand whether it is Habib
or Chaitanya or Srinivasa somebody else, right? How do you
understand that? It is very difficult, right? So in that
situation, we are going to adapt the technology that is known as
a machine learning algorithm to use it. Okay,
okay. Now, again, from your questions only. For example,
they said that happy with the function is very simple. So you
are, you know that the kind of function and we are using so
simple linear regression is very easy to guess. For example, for
the problem of 1357,
so what is the w1 w1 is the first
coefficient, right? How much we got two? What is the w2 w2 is
the intercept. How much we got one. How do you know this one?
So for example, if I put this mathematically,
so let us say x is 0123,
4y, is 13579,
let us take the question here, so 012345,
and Y values are, for example, 12345678,
and the nine,
okay, something like this. Now, tell me for zero, how much one
for zero. We got one. It is the one for one. We got three one.
We got three for two. We got five for three. We got seven so.
For four, we got nine. If you draw the line here, where it is
touching at one, so we know that the intercept will be how much
one. Now, if you click into this, this is the slope. What is
the formula for slope? Difference in y by difference in
X, correct. So if you take this point, what is this point is?
Point is two and five, correct? Whatever this point, this point
will be one and
three. So this is x1 this is y1 this is x2 and y2 so if you keep
that y2 minus y1 so three minus 5x, two minus x1 one minus two,
this will be negative two by negative one. How much you
getting two? That means the slope is two. We know that this
is a line equation. General. Line equation will be y is equal
to mx plus c, where m will be two. Slope times of x, intercept
is one. So this way, this complete calculations will be in
the black box of linear regression. It is happening. So
every algorithm, they have their own mathematics intuition behind
that. So in that mathematical intuition, it is trying to put
the data understand, coming up with a solution. For example, if
you have something like the data is not in this format. Then, for
example, we have a data in this format, something like this. Can
I apply linear regression here?
No way. Correct. We need to use
poly poly regression, something like that. So how things? How do
you know that which algorithm we need to use it. Okay, those
things we'll discuss now. Okay, later. So this is about how
algorithm is working.
Manoj Kumar saw okay, why is it continuous? What is no? I didn't
understand, no, what is no. We cannot use that linear at you.
Yeah, exactly perfect. Thank you.
Okay, so now, what is our algorithm function? What is our
algorithm function? Algorithm function is finding the best
parameters and coefficient so that which can create a correct
outputs. This is the job of any classical machine learning
algorithm. So when I say ml, ml in the terms, we can say
classical machine learning. We call it deep learning and the
generative AI. These are the three terminology we use
generally. Okay, so classical machine learning is completely
from SK learn package. We use it deep learning. We are going to
use, apart from Sklar, we are going to some of the frameworks.
We call it as a Keras, TensorFlow pytorch. Through
that, we are going to use the neural networks. For example,
building a convolution, neural networks, a current neural
networks, large short term memory, LSTMs, GaNS, generated
adversar network transformers, and all those things comes into
deep learning later onwards, we use generative example, like,
how do you build a large language models? What is the
retrieval, augmented generation, all those things? Okay, so, but
today, as it is a first class, we are just concentrating on
classical machine learning, and we'll try to understand how
things will work. Okay, so in the chat box, no need to unmute
yourself. Just use the chat box to answer some of the questions.
Okay, plotting of data helps in predicting the algorithms to
use. Yes. David, so plotting, they don't do it actually.
They use the statistical methodology to predict the
answers. Okay. Now, for example, I have given set of numbers, I
said partition into two, two parts. Okay, so what you can do
either, for example, you can think in two ways, a different
ways. Everybody can do different one thing is all the single day
numbers I can keep in one group, and all the two digit numbers I
can keep in another group. This is some people, they think like
that. Another people, all the odd numbers in one group, all
the even numbers in another group. Some other everybody,
they have don't their own techniques to, you know, group
them, correct. So here, if you take this example, if I take
this one, you say that Habib, why you are taking this one? Why
don't you take single and two digit separation. Question comes
in, right? So how do you understand so sometimes and a
single two functions also can be a coming up. Now here you have
two terms. One is a supervised learning. Nine, you came up with
the next term known as a unsupervised learning and
supervised learning. So let me give you a brief of what is
supervised and unsupervised. Okay.
Okay, so
now let us take first classical machine learning algorithm. Now
this.
ML is generally divided into two parts. We call it as a
supervised learning.
Second part, we call it as a
unsupervised
learning. Then we have a reinforcement learning, those
things semi supervised learning will not discuss. In coming
sessions, we'll discuss. Let us concentrate today on these two,
supervised learning, unsupervised learning, for
example, supervised learning is just now have given an example.
X is 012, 3y, is 1357,
so x is the input, wise the output. So there is a output
existing, correct. That means we have a prediction column that is
known as a supervised learning. For example, I have
height and weight. I need to find the gender. For example,
height is 170 weight is 170 centimeters. Okay, weight is 80,
kilo. I said it is a male. Height is 120 weight is 60. Let
us say it's a female. Weight is 130, and some 70. Let us say it
is a female.
So if you look into these two problems, there is a target
column existing. Correct? What is the target column here?
Target column is finding the gender here. Target column is
finding the next number. So target existing. Then this is
known as a supervised learning. We call it so that means, in any
machine learning algorithm, when use the data, if you have a
target column, we call it as a supervised learning Perfect.
Now, in the supervised learning, again, the data is sometimes
continuous. Sometimes is a decree discrete, that means into
the classes sometimes continuous. So if the data is
continuous, we call it as a regression. What do we call
regression? If the data is discrete, not continuous, then
we call it as a classification,
understood the basic difference. First of all, what is supervised
learning? Supervised Learning is nothing, but there is a target
column existing. We call it as a supervised learning now, in the
target column, if the continuous values, we call it as a
regression and classification. Now, just now, I have given a
problem statement, so when you see this, you understand that,
okay, this is a regression so what you will do, you will apply
all regression algorithms only. You don't use classification
algorithm. Okay. Now in the chat box, I want to see the people to
type, for example,
uh,
uh, data you mean target for is no data is a combination of
input and target. Revati, okay, input and target. We call it as
a data, correct x and y, we call it as a data.
Now, now tell me minimum temperature is given. I need to
find the max temperature. Minimum temperature, 20 Max is
2521
20 320-526-3035,
tell me this problem is a regression problem or
classification
problem.
Somebody, okay. Somebody said, classification,
how come classification? Do you have only two classes or three
classes? We have values are continuous, correct? 2325 2635
can be many. I have given some samples, maybe a lot of
examples, right? This is regression problem. Okay, now
another question I will give you,
for example, I'm taking insulin,
okay, and the skin thickness,
and then BMI, I'm going to say diabetic, yes or no, yes or no.
So we have some data. We have now tell me the target column is
diabetic column, and the remaining is the feature. So is
it a classification or regression?
Classification? Classification, perfect. So now you understood,
what is the classification? Maybe you have around 10 classes
or 20 different classes. Are there repeating again and again,
we call it as a classification. If you have continuous number,
then we call it as a
we can call it as a regression problem. So target is two type
regression and classification. Correct. Aditi, you understood
well. So target, we have two columns that is a either
regression or a classification. So if the target column
existing. We call it as a supervised learning, understood,
if there is no target column, we don't say it's a supervised
learning. We call it as a unsupervised learning. In an
unsupervised learning, what we do? We just group them. We don't
have any targets. So for example, just now you took the
example, 711, 1513,
something like this, only with some data.
Given, I said, group them. What you will do? You will group into
two groups, one as a single digit, second is a double digit.
So this is known as a unsupervised learning.
And one question, does classification always Boolean?
No. For example, classification can be any classes, many number
of classes. Okay, for example, generally, we use Iris data. We
call it as iris flower classification. There we have
sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. Then we
have a class. Here we have three kinds of flowers, Setosa,
varicosa,
virginica, so depending upon the sepal length is 1.5 6.2 7.1 0.5,
1.6 7.2 5.0 2.3 1.2 1.0 5.2 2.3
now tell me this problem is a classification, or it is a
regression. What it is classification?
Classification, perfect. So how many features we here? We have?
How many columns are the input columns, four or four columns?
What is the target column? Output column is class. Class
consists of how many different values?
Can I say? This is a discrete, discrete in the sense, yeah. So
then what do you call this kind of problem? Statement,
classification? We call it, okay. So what is an output or
prediction in Super unsupervised learning as there is no target?
Okay, probably we're doing just clustering. We call it grouping
them. For example, in the Netflix, what they will do
depending upon your choices. They'll group the movies so they
group all the you know, what is sci fi movies together according
to the content, and they group all the action movies together,
a thrill movies together, like that. Kind of Okay.
Classification is about grouping the data in one or more group.
No. Santosh, classification is not grouping the data in one or
more groups. Target column consists of different classes,
so depending upon the features, we say whether it belongs to
this class or that class. Okay, so ISO, regression and
classification are valid for both supervised and unsupervised
learning. Boss, you are again unrelated question, regression
and classification is part of only supervised learning.
Unsupervised Learning. There is no target column, just we group
them, clustering.
Okay,
different class or columns, okay. Can it go into undefined
class? No. Sandhya, maximum. We say that around 50 to 60
classes. If you have, we call it a supervised learning.
Otherwise, if you have more than 5060, again, we'll take it as a
regression only good question, okay,
can classification be used for regression problem? No.
Classification is different, and regression is different
depending upon a problem statement, you have to apply
either regression problem or algorithm are classification
algorithm, if the classification data always contains different
set of outputs without any relation, will model provide the
solution? Definitely, complex problems will be answered.
Maheshwar, using convolution, means neural networks we use
generally, okay, okay, so now you got the difference. What is
the regression? Regression is if the target column consists of
continuous values. Can you give some of the examples in the chat
box, any problem statements you may came across? We can say
that, okay, this can be a regression, something like that.
We can say that repetition testing, when people do the
regression, regression called repetition testing,
house prediction, sales data.
Okay, so let me take another example when a new employee
giants in HR want to decide what is the salary. So he is taking
age of the person, qualification of the person previous salary.
Okay, then he's predicting the he's going to give the salary.
Now tell me this problem is a regression problem or
classification problem, regression regulation problems.
Perfect, perfect, perfect, well understood. Now, let us do
another example. Let us take another example.
I have a student grade. Okay, so I'm going to take grades in
English, science, Telugu, Hindi, math, something I'm going to
give a grade according to that. So grades will be A plus A, B
plus B, something like this. Now tell me, is this a regression
problem or a classification
classification problem, perfect, perfect. Now you understood so
classification in the sense we have a target column with
defined categories, can I say like that? So our discrete
values, we can say that comes into
classification problem if it is a.
Continuous values, like you have a numbers, one, 210, 2030,
something like that. We call it as a regression problem. Okay.
Now let us jump into the slides.
Sorry, so classification is a fixed output, I can say that.
And the regression it is of non fixed output, variable output,
variable output. Yeah, in that way, also we can do it.
Okay. Now let us take this example, given set of numbers.
When I say, is there no there is no target, correct? Now we don't
have any target,
okay, let me take some questions. Classification is
discrete, defined perfect, fewer, temperature crosses fewer
is equal. Temperature should cross 100 perfect. What is the
error? Example on Super as learning problems, clustering,
recommendation systems, perfect or HR example, regression,
please explain very simple sai Krishna in HR example, I said
that whenever you join a new company, HR started, instead of,
you know, manually calculating the salary. He said, can you
build a model? So what you are doing, you are taking the a, you
know, for example, age of the person. You are taking his
qualification, previous experience, then you have a
target column as a salary. So sometimes people will get 50,000
per month, sometimes one lakh per month, three lakhs per
month, four lakhs per month, like that, right? So the target
column having continuous value. So this comes into which
category, regression category, no. But in case,
if two few employees are same qualification, in that case, it
can be a classification.
I'm not predicting the classification, right? I'm
trying to predict the salary. For example, have given if the
variable salary is there? Okay,
if you have according to the role fixed, salary, is there?
Then it comes to which category classification Correct, yeah,
depending upon the problem statement. Yeah, good. Now, this
is the unsupervised learning. We call it why? Because we are
trying to group them. So how is the right target here in the
column? We don't have any column correct. We just we have simple
values. Are there we need to group them. We call it as a
unsupervised learning. Now coming to for example, I have
hemoglobin levels, I want to decide whether it is anemic or
not. So, for example, anemic past two cases are 8.5 9.2 7.478
negative cases are 15, 14.9 14.2 13.8 now tell me, is it a
classification or regression? A classification? Yes.
Classification. Perfect. Why? Because, if the value is 8.5
hemoglobin level, we call it as a positive P, if it is 15, we
got we call it as n. So how many classes we have? Only two
classes, either positive or negative. For example, let us
take Dengue positive or negative. They are taking the
platelet levels and their CRP and all those things. Tell me
this problem is a classification
or regression.
Okay, maybe more it is not fixed value.
Which one dengue, dengue, okay, you're asking for the yes or no
languages or not, then it is a
exactly classification. Now Kiran is given very good example
that government employee service can be classification is
experience. Grade is always fixed. Yeah, that according to
the problem statement, it changes. But our problem
statement is very something like that. We took it perfect, good.
Okay, okay. This is something we are writing. We are saying that
less than 10 is there. We say it is a positive class. So for
example, he is anemic not we can say he is not anemic in the
future. So here, if you have a closer look into the data, we
can say that the data is something we have some
interpretations right the combinations, so sample and the
label, so which is going to give us the
if there is a label, we call it as a supervised learning. If
there is no label, what we are going to say it is a
unsupervised learning. So sometimes they will give linear
equations. Sometimes we have a complex functions we are need to
generate. For example, in the previous statement, 2x plus one,
it's a simple linear equation. But sometimes it can be a
complex equation. So machine learning models are the one
which are used to you know, what do you call solve the problems?
Now the question is, here we are going to have a two things. One
thing is okay. In a previous example, let us understand we
gave the input as 0123,
for example, 1357,
as an output to the model. Model is taking the data, so when the
model is taking the data and understanding the pattern. This
is known as training. What do we call? We call it as a training
in machine learning. Terminology, okay,
using the training what is happening? It is trying to find
the coefficient and it is trying to find the intercept. Agree?
Everyone?
So when the pattern is linear regression, then it is trying to
find the coefficient and intercept. For example, if you
have more than one feature, then what happens? We are going to
get more than one coefficient and last one is the one
intercept. If it is a linear regression problem, okay. So
here we have a training. Then after training, it is creating a
computational function. We use that computational function to
do the computing okay? So, for example, if you take into this
problem statement, we have some of the medical records, okay, of
the patient. We need to predict whether the person having a
presence of malaria, so or not so, we approached to subject
matter expert like a doctors, and we gave the sample to them.
And the doctors, that means pathological doctors, they
labeled it as a malaria and not malaria. So they did how many
classifications to whether it says zero means no malaria and
one means there is a malaria, for example, like that. So
either we can say yes or no, or we can say zero or one, whatever
it may be the target column, okay, so that may be two
classes. Are there? We call it as a supervised learning
sometimes we have multi class. For example, just now I take an
example of a Iris data. Right in Iris data, we have multiple
classes, correct Iris, Setosa, it is virginica, like that very
cosa, those things understood. So depending upon those data
samples, it is going to identify. There will come
across, or we call it as a feature. We need it. So now the
term x is known as feature. What do we call in our terminology,
machine learning terminology, we call it as a feature. And why is
the prediction column? So what about the F? F is the prediction
function? Three terminologies you have to understand. For
example, when I predicting the Iris data sample, sepal length,
sepal width, petal length, petal width. And then I have a class.
Now tell me, what are the features now, sepal and sepal
width, petal and petal width are the features whatever the class.
Class is the target column, and whatever the function I am
getting, that function is known as a prediction function,
correct,
clear or not?
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Now, generally traditional
programming, what we did, we took the data and then we have
given to the computer. It is generating the output. That is
what in the beginning we have, and we try to understand then,
whereas in a machine learning, we are giving a data, input x
and output Y, this x, can I say features?
Yes? Can I say this as a prediction, yes,
column, or we call it as a target column. This program is
known as a function f of x, perfect. Great. Understood.
Okay.
Now, label, sir,
come again this output column, why do you also sometimes
address this as a label? Also, yes, there's a label, target
column, prediction column, like that. Okay,
okay. Now, let us do one thing. Let us take up the question
before going for the break.
Okay, and now the stage is yours, one by one. No. Need to
hurry.
Just
then we can start the next just raise your hands in a sequence,
and we can take it. Okay, one by one, please. Okay, go ahead.
Chaitanya, come in. Hi. So in the previous diagram, the PPT,
when we say that the input and the expected output,
there's a machine and the output is a function,
which part of this sequence diagram is called as a model, a
complete this whole set is called a model, or machine is
model or function is a model.
We call this as a actually model and function. Also, some people,
they name it as a model only.
Okay.
When we, when you are,
we are training a model or building a new model. This is
training the model. This is the output model, generated model,
okay, once we train the generated function or the model
is what, we use it. Use it. Yeah, we'll use it. Got it?
Yeah. Next,
next question.
So in the previous,
yeah, in the previous diagram, you're showing data plus target
and then outputting the program, right? But initially, when we
started, data is nothing but influence plus input plus
output, right?
Yeah. So here the target is, like, the same as output, or
it's a different.
No boss. Just for understanding. We took it as a data. We call
it, but later onwards, here in our machine learning after now,
you are a machine learning basic engineer, you call it this as a
features and the target. Then this is the function correct.
This is the correct anatomy,
understood.
Yeah. Next, Hello, sir.
My question is that we are saying that here we are not
doing emails. So I think inside the supervised learning model,
there's something somewhere, somewhere we have got the code
details like that.
No, we cannot see that it
is a black box only. You can see the prediction this. I want. I
wish to understand how the black box is implemented in the black
when we discuss the algorithm at that time, we'll discuss
baranjay today. Just understand the anatomy only.
Okay,
when we start with linear regression.
Oh, you.
Come again. Okay, thank you. Yeah. Next. Ravi, Teja, what's
your question? Yeah, so for HR example that you have given so
with the input that we have, we are saying that we are finding
the salary. So we said that is a regression. Now if I say that
with the input data should be we we should decide whether Should
we hire the resource or not. Then we say that that is a
classification. Perfect, perfect. Okay. Thank you. Yeah.
Once you are done with your question, please lower your
hands. Okay, then I will take the question. Jay pal, go ahead.
Yes, sir. Actually, I am not understand 100% on this today's
class, frankly, telling just 10 to 15% only I understand that
class. What do you understand that 10 to 15% tell me
this classification and supervise unsupervised.
You understood? Yeah, I understood, but not completely.
It's hard to digest.
Yeah, first time it will feels like that Jaipur, but you
understand the terminology supervised, unsupervised or not?
Yeah, that understand supervised. And I think if we
give input and we will get output, right? That is, that is
terminology I understand for supervisor, supervised,
opposite, unsupervised. If we give any input, we don't expect
the expected target, right? Yes, perfect. Group them, perfect.
That's take away. Still, no. We are discussing that only, and
that classification and the terminology which you said some
SW, PW, this. Those things no need to understand. There are
features we call it, for example, Jaipal. When you are
going to the doctor, their doctor want to predict whether
you are prone to diabetic or not. What they are doing, they
are giving you some tests, right? For example, He is asking
for insulin test. He is asking for your weight, he is asking
for Skin Thickness, something. Then, according to that, he's
predicting that, okay, you are prone to diabetic. Then he start
the medicine, correct? Now, when you when he's coming to you as a
Jaipal, can you build a model? What he will ask you will ask
the doctor, actually, how do you know that whether the person is
prone to diabetic? Now he's saying that, Jaipal, I'm going
to take his skin thickness, I'm going to take his age, I'm going
to take his BMI, depending upon that, I'm going to say he's a
diabetic. Now you will take that kind of data. How much data will
take, for example, say, 100 sample you are taking from the
doctor. Then what you will do by you build a model. Model will
understand all by using 100 examples, when you give a new
patient data, model will say, Okay, you are a diabetic. Take
the medicine like that. That is what AIML is doing. Understood
now, yeah, I understand. That is the takeaway. That's it. Yeah,
great. Aish, yeah, welcome. Aish,
I love that. Frank. Frank, Mr. J, pal, good, okay. Aish, yeah,
so in
the previous diagram, when we see the function, so even the
coefficients are also derived automatically. MH
plus c, so M, N, the coefficient of the intercept that is also
along with the equation, this linear equation,
exactly that model is deriving right. Okay, so it's both the
function as well as the coefficient, okay, that
coefficient and intercept together. We call it as function
as Okay, okay, yeah, all right, yeah. Revati,
yeah, hi, sir. So maybe I need to understand bit more on
unsupervised learning for the exam. See, today's session only
concentrate on supervised learning. Okay, next session we
have there we understand supervised learning
implementation. Today is just terminology understood. That's
it.
Okay.
Let me like you have given the set of numbers and you wanted to
group as even an odd right? We can even name them as even even
target in the target column. We can mention it as an even on a
target, and those numbers can be grouped in.
To even and odd, right? That way we can get in a target, right?
Like male and female, you can say even on the odd. Exactly
that way, it can become a classification problem, right?
Yes, it can be. It can be, depending upon your problem
statement, it can be regression, or it can be a classification
for example, if you are making a target column and find to
forgive a number. I want to find whether it's even or odd, then
it is
classification problem. Are you just you want to group them?
That is a supervisor, unsupervised learning like that,
okay? If at all we want to go with a grouping the if our
intention is to grouping, then it becomes unsupervised
learning. Exactly. Okay, okay, yeah, nothing. Go ahead, yeah,
my question is more related to the diaries classification
versus the malaria yes or no thing. So when we have it, when
we have a definitive thing like yes or no, it will become a
regression. And when there is a classification boss, yes or no
classification.
Okay,
anything in the target column, one or two classes are there.
For example, simple to understand, that's a
classification. If you have something like minimum
temperature is given, I need to find max temperature. That is a
regression Correct. Yeah, because I think I all heard the
test classification, so yeah,
next Tarun, once you have done with the question, please lower
your hand so that I can go to the next one, please. Okay,
Tarun, sir. This is related to unsupervised learning. So
basically, model means we need to try net there should be input
and output, since for unsupervised learning, there is
no output that we are training with, like how it's going to
predict. It's not predicting Tarun. It is during groups. The
fact that we use a K means algorithm like that. Okay, that
is the reason I said we are not going to dip dig, you know,
digger, you know, digging more into super unsupervised coming
sessions will see that, okay, today, just Supras learning,
that's it.
Raghu, yeah. So the question is, when you define classes after
that, you could have classes that contained
the regression
categories? Also, could that be? No way, no class, no, no, I want
to have each class as a separate model, again, created. That
is your problem statement, right? Your problem statement
either you can use but the definition is, if it is having
continuous values, it falls into regression. If it is having only
different values, like one or two different values, then it is
a classification later onwards. How do you disperse? That is
your wish. No, but, I mean, will there be some data that could be
have multiple classes and like you implement multiple
algorithms to No, no, we don't have like that in ML. We don't
do that only one target, only thing. When you're implementing
deep learning at that time, we have two out two target columns.
It's possible. We call it as a functional programming Okay,
okay, okay. Thank you, Mahesh, please go ahead with your
question. Yes, you might have answered this question. But when
how does the model starts evolving?
Start at that when you do fit, dot fit at the time. Okay?
I mean to say, like, for example, in the case of
classification models, right? Based on certain inputs, we know
that the data can be transferred into certain groups, yes, the
model stops seeing
new patterns in the data, what would be the outcome in that
scenario? Outcoming is Mahesh. We call it as a continuous
learning. So we have to create a pipeline every now and then, we
need to train the model, similar to chat GPT, whenever it does,
doesn't answer there is every at 12pm every night, something they
do the training similar way we need to do the training that is
continuous learning. We call it that will be discussed in
chapter number four.
Yeah, Chakrapani, sorry, you were showing about the features.
Does the model on its own know which features are required to
predict?
Are we? Yeah, yeah. For that, we for that, we use some
statistical packages. Are there Chakrapani, that is, we call it
as a depending upon the correlation it predicts. Okay,
so those things, when we discuss about in chapter number two,
feature engineering, those things will happen. Okay, okay,
thank you. Yeah. Mahesh, go ahead.
Yeah. My question is on generative a LLM model, so the
response is always no questions on generative we are not into J,
ready, A, now, right, okay, so basically,
yeah, we'll continue feeding that model in generative A,
right? It's not yet similar to that continuous learning. We
call it an AIML, also, okay, got it. Thanks.
Yeah, welcome Kalwa Sri Lakshmi, yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, can
you open Google up?
Okay, here like, since we know the pattern, so you are
printing, but by default, algorithm cannot provide a
pattern, but if I don't know pattern, I just know the input,
and I just, uh, got out, like, expecting some values after some
numbers, but I'm not able to predict the pattern, which
pattern it is that case,
we are not this won't happen. This is for your understanding
only. We are printing, okay, up to this only. We use it in,
okay, yeah, so and again, while deploying the general while
deploying just since we are now, we don't know pattern and what
is behind scene, what is going on that also, we don't know,
still just apply the model. Still fit only. We will deploy
that. I'll show you after the break, I'll show you how to
deploy also, to get you some idea. Okay, simple example.
Okay, okay. And one more question, I'm sorry, one more
question,
only, Python is suitable for this kind of exercise, or do you
have any other language? Actually? R is there? Java? Is
there? Scale is there? But they are not popular because the
community doesn't support all ml algorithms. Okay, only Python is
the one with supportable. Okay. Thank Yeah. Welcome Santosh. Go
ahead.
So these concepts you have explained, but I just wanted to
take one more step. So in supervised classification,
example, you gave insulin, diabetic insulin, okay, mi or
features, and adding diabetic column as a target makes this
problem as a supervised classification problem. If the
example doesn't have diabetic column, it will become
unsupervised, unsupervised, but the output is still same, that
for each of this row we are predicting if it is diabetic or
not, only if the presence and absence of target makes it
supervised and unsupervised learning, right? Perfect.
Santosh, good, understand. Thank you. Yeah.
Ramesh Babu, please go ahead
classification models, right? Is it always the output a binary
one, not binary. It can be multinomial, anything, okay,
like in the example we see for malaria, we are just checking
for yes or no, right? What about the Iris data sample set or
sorry, like that. Three classes, right? Okay, for example, if you
are student grade, AA plus BB plus CC plus right, uh huh, like
that.
Okay,
yeah, vija
vaskar, can, can a machine learning problem involve both
classification, regression tasks, sometimes, but we use
that is in advanced, you know, deep learning. We'll discuss
that sometimes the combination, sometimes you need to predict
the salary, predict the marks, also with the grade, also
sometimes, for example, okay, in that situation, we can have a
regression and classification together, so that will also fall
under supervisor learning, supervised learning only, yeah.
Super is learning only, yeah, yeah. Okay, thanks, yeah.
Harish, no, the last one to go, yeah. So the fact that you have
picked a linear regression, like, I mean, generally,
somebody plays with multiple models and sees which model is
better. That's how it works, right? Exactly. Okay, yeah,
that. So let me take the questions from
chat box. Can you give one more example of unsupervised
learning? Netflix recommendation? Good. Sort of
thanks for it, as there is no specific output, as there could
be more than one, yes, sometimes it can be a group, according to
the, you know, the fiction thriller, something like that,
any form of clustering or grouping is unsupervised
learning, the model figures, they belong together without
labeling. Perfect, come on, product suggestion, animation,
good. Fraud detection, your credit card usage could have
some unusual patterns. Perfect. Fraud may go into
classification, whether it is a fraud happened or not. Perfect.
As a consumer of model, I see inaccurate result. Can I train
it and change the model you are? That is where the data scientist
role is generally. We take the model, and we'll see the
accuracy is not as expected. We need to again retrain the model
with different other algorithms. Okay, in unsupervised learning,
if you don't have an output or target column, on what basis,
for example, on some of the basis, like, you know, depending
upon their features, we can group them, okay, model will
take out of those things, okay. Middle the target is to get the
equation. So is the output of the model. Predict further as
the input to the model. I'm thinking how to predict whether
our distant dates, yeah, go on, saying it is not the target is
an equation, actually part of the equations. That means it is
going to take the combination like, you know, intercept, and
the coefficients like that. So it is learning and then it is
putting into the equation format. So the black box you
cannot directly print the equation for your understanding.
What I did is I split that and kept into a functional form.
Format, okay? So that is where the work of, you know, the AIML
engineer comes into,
you know, work. So, so take away of this session is, let me just
give you a brief, because we are going for the break before going
for a break. A takeaway of the session is, first, you need to
understand the basic difference between traditional programming
and the AIML. This is what, okay. And the second thing is,
you need to understand what is the data and what is an output.
This is one, or we call it as a label.
Then the third one is we are trying to understand what is
supervised learning in this supervised learning regression
and the classification. This is all the takeaway of this
session. Okay, if you got these things, then you're good to go
with the first session. Okay,
okay, great. So let us do one thing. There is a break of half
an hour. So now it is 1050
you need half an hour break, or 20 minutes break. So put it in
the
chat. I have one question. Maybe, yeah, I'll take the
question. Hanu, just 20
minutes is enough. So somebody said 30 minutes, okay, as a
first day, let us take 30 minutes. Later on, it will take
20 minutes. Okay, so now the break starts. Now it is 1050
we are going to start by 1120 we're again, okay, so meanwhile,
I'll stay for one more you know, 10 minutes here, I'll be here.
1120 we'll be back. So I'm here for 10 more minutes. If you have
any questions, you can just ask me the questions I'll take up.
Okay, if you don't have a question, you can take a break,
have your coffee or something. Go ahead. Okay.
Yeah. So, so my question is,
it's more related to the supervised learning. So I have
multiple features, and I want and I want to determine the
column or the target column. So at the same time, depending upon
the user input, suppose, if the user is giving multiple
features, determine
the target for an example,
if it is, what is your question? I didn't understand. Features
are given. Determine the output, okay, what is the question?
There are multiple features, and the target column is, it can be
malaria, dengue, or TB, or anything, right? So this comes
classification, yeah, my I'm just checking my understanding.
So suppose, with the same kind of data set, I'm giving the
features, and I want to determine
what is the type of disease it is.
So in that case, also, I should prefer a classification
algorithms. Yes, perfect. Okay, so suppose if, depending upon
the features, it does not fall in any of these categories, and
in such cases, that depends upon the accuracy of the model,
so it definitely it will fall either into regression or
classification or clustering, any of three in the world, any
problem, correct,
correct. So now accuracy is again, different thing. Accuracy
is something when you use, for example, you have 10 algorithms,
every algorithm, mathematics is different implementation. Okay.
So when you use one algorithm, you got good accuracy. Other
algorithms, we got very good accuracy compared to the
previous one. Whichever is giving the highest accuracy, you
have to consider that it is completely hit and
run. Okay, okay, yeah, I think, yeah. Welcome,
sir. Can you please supervising and supervisory?
Supervised Learning is, for example,
I have height is given, weight is given. I want to find what is
the gender. How many genders are there? For example, male and
female. So we have a target column existing, right? So I'm
taking height and weight, and they need to find what is the
gender that is known as a supervised learning. But now in
the gender column, how many you have a continuous values or
different values, two classes, right? So two classes means we
call it as a classification. What do we call classification?
For example, when height is given, I want to find the
weight. Height is 120, weight is 3080, 7068,
okay, target column, what is the target column, weight, weight,
but what is the values here? Can I say ABC? No, we have some
different values every time, right? So this is known as a
regression. Very simple, understood,
yeah, plastic and regression. I understood ah, supervised and
supervised, I might need to dig up on it. Okay, so here, if you
see target, is that here we have a target, right? So this is, we
call it as a supervised learning. Understood, gotcha.
Okay. Now let us say I have a movie. In the movie, I have some
thrilling action, something.
In another movie, I have another kind of, you know, content,
another movie, I have another content. Otherwise, let us say
now what I want to do. I want to group them. There is no target
column, so depending upon their content, I'm going to group
them. For example, I want to group them as one category
because they are all having action and another category they
allow having sci fi, depending upon their features, I'm
classifying just I'm trying to group them that is known as a
unsupervised learning. There is no target. For example, you have
something like one, numbers are given. 1-234-567-8910,
I said group them. There is no target, right? How do you group
them? Either you can group them up to one to five as one group,
six to 10 as an another group, or you can take all odd numbers
as another one group, even numbers as a one another group
that is known as a clustering that falls into which category,
unsupervised learning, clear, understood. Yeah. Great,
sir.
Yeah, go ahead. Maheshwa is machine learning. Always talks
about mathematical models are, this is one, one way to solve
problem. In machine learning,
this is one way to solve the problem. But every whenever
solve the problem, what we do is we try to get a it is something
like Maheshwar in layman. Example, when we go to the
doctor, you have some golden cough. One doctor will give you
azithro. One doctor will give taxi. One that different
antibiotics, right, correct. The combinations of that is
different, so sometimes one will hit and you'll cure it. Similar
way. We have an algorithm. The mathematics behind that is
little bit different. So when we consume the model, we'll
understand if you get the accuracy good, that's it.
Okay, yeah, yeah. Ashok,
Habib, so I have a question with respect to the rail linear
model. So let's say, in,
in the multi dimensional, let's say, like, if you have multiple
features, right? So there may be few,
let's say, like in HR, example, like some people may be
negotiated to different salary, it may not be the fixed again.
Don't get deeper into those. Show the target understanding is
just try to understand. I'm trying to see again, everybody,
if you're getting into deeper, something happens, I say now you
need AI people, I will depend something that different. But
yeah, just, I'm trying to put it that the target is something
which is not into classes. For example, if you are in Oracle,
they give a role as ICM, you know, interview, individual
contributor role, ICR one, ICR two, ICR three. Already their
fixed salaries. Are there, right? So those can be
classification. That cannot be a regression, correct,
right? Yeah, I agree. Yeah, that's the you have to
understand. What is the target column look like. Implementation
is your part,
right? I have a follow up question on it. I would
recommend, if there is an error, right? So, like, I mean error
determination will be multiple parameters depends, right? Like,
I mean, it is in the advanced session. You people are in Okay,
six sessions, and you're asking the questions in unit four.
Okay, yeah, okay, I got it. Okay, yeah, thank you.
Gomathesh, yeah, give me some time to have a break coffee also
boss. Okay, yeah. So, for an AI developer, how much of
mathematics proficiency is like enough? Like, concept wise or,
okay, I'm into industry gamut. I will tell you that no need for
mathematics. Zero mathematics is enough.
Okay, okay, yeah, because, if you are doing some research and
going forward you want to come up with a new algorithm, then
mathematics is needed, but just to use it is not required,
unless you are developing required. Yes. Madhuri, yeah, I
will put all this LMS. All those things are available, okay? And
Neha, this is not needed. So this is actually simple. People
are in internet they are doing a lot of things, you know,
together to just get the hits and everything. Don't worry, you
don't need any I'll say that even if you don't have a coding,
good coding skill, also you can be a very good data scientist.
I'll prove that. End of the sessions. Okay, yep, sure.
Yeah. And you don't need to carry up with any mathematics
boss. Just come up like a lame and sit in the class and end of
the first unit, and when you are implementing the third unit, you
will see that, okay, we can do it. So that kind of when I'm
taking technical sessions. At that time, we'll discuss no code
to complete implementation. How do you do it? Okay, don't worry.
You are on me. Jaipal, ready for the question? Yeah, sir, that
first expression you written, right? Linear expression. How do
you return on board? How so 2x plus one you return? Right? So
actually, I'm telling I'm not understanding, uh, sorry to say,
July. SQL, background, but this.
Okay, no problem. Good question. After one or two classes, don't
get panic, okay, just listen to the class. They may do not trade
the pre defined sessions because of my office work, I didn't get
much. Yeah, that's where you are. A little bit confused. So
actually, we know that the equation is y is equal to mx
plus c. This M is known as a coefficient in mathematics.
Terminology, this is called as an intercept. Okay, so our
algorithm is finding the coefficient and intercept, and
we are substituting here we are getting the equation. That's it.
Yeah, if we know that output, then like, 1357, but if we don't
know what value next comes, then what? How do we write the
expression like we don't write the expression, we don't write
the expression, we just use the model. But today, to make you
compare with the traditional programming and our What do you
call AIML models? I use that that only just to make you
understand so in when you are doing your AI job, you're not
supposed to print your what do you say the models? Okay, no.
Need to print the equation. Just consume it. That's it. Okay,
really, sir, I am telling I'm understanding it is taking me
time because of not don't get panic this one, once you are
getting one or two sessions, definitely you understand. Don't
worry. You will say later that. Habi, good to go with those
things. Okay, okay, okay, great. Thank you sir. Yeah, thank you
sir. Because when learn it three classes, Python and mathematics,
we thought how to handle this. Now you solve that headache,
mathematics and more. Coding is not required. So that is a
relaxed not required. It's only Manoj. Don't worry. End of the
sessions. You say that. Okay, this is what, because now we are
in an era of using all the AI tools. I'll I'll show you how to
use those tools, and just take it, that's it. So when you say
say, after the unit one, you understand that, okay, I don't
need all the statistics. Just to make you, you know, little bit
acquainted. Some people, they say that, okay, like me I am
now. Some people supervising five students from Golden Gate
University for PhD. Okay, so later on, she said that, okay,
let us do some enhancement in existing algorithm. Definitely,
you need that statistical point if you want to become a
researcher deeper into statistics, otherwise, consumer,
you don't need to worry about those things.
Thank you, Chef, yeah. Okay, great. So we'll have a break and
we'll be back by 1120
last question, Neha. Last question, yeah, yeah. So since
you mentioned, mathematics is not important. So what happens
then in the interview, actually, so if
then
Suresh, technically, I am into when I interview my people, I
never ask, what is the mathematical equation or
anything? Interview, nobody will ask you if it is a position, is
a research position? Then they will ask you, okay, so just they
will ask you, like, whether it's a linear regression. Means, what
is a linear regression? How do you explain that's the okay. So
nobody will ask you the mathematics behind every
algorithm. Don't worry. They will say, how do you decide that
this algorithm is good for you? You have to
be in a position to explain that these are the reasons I adopted
this algorithm that you are going to learn. Okay,
okay,
practical experience. I mean, I mean, real time experience. Can
we crack the job? AIML,
definitely. Madhuri, you can. But how do you do that? Once we
take the technical sessions, we'll show you. Okay, don't
worry. Thank you, sir. Welcome back. Shall we start?
Yes, sir, happy. I have one question on the previous topic.
Okay, what's the question? Is it okay to so basically, while
explaining about traditional things versus AIML things,
right? You mentioned, we look for three things. One is
pattern, mathematical implementation and historical
data. Okay, so trying to correlate with the AIML thing,
like we have data, and then predicting function, right? So
what is the output? So can we say the history? Can we map the
historical data as input plus output and mathematical
implementation as the function, predicting function perfect.
What is pattern? Can what pattern can be mapped to?
Pattern is nothing. But from the pattern only, we are getting
mathematical equation right. Yeah. So those two are entering,
right, so we don't have separate items. Okay, thank you
very. Good. Perfect Understanding.
Okay,
right.
Okay. So now,
question, have got 100 1000s of mail. I sort of
want to create a group out of them. I don't already know what
the group could be, promotional, social monitoring. So even.
So I wish to classify them, I need to unsupervised learning.
So identify group, right? So then once we have a group, then
we can use create classification for the numerous. Use this
approach, correct, perfect, govern. So once you have
clusters, that means the groups, then you are giving some label
that is known as a semi supervised learning. So okay,
coming sessions we'll discuss those things. So once you group
them, you are going to give a label that is semi supervised
learning. We call it, okay, so today just concentrate on
supervised learning. Going forward in the sessions, we'll
discuss in depth what is unsupervised learning and what
is semi supervised learning, what is reinforcement learning
like that? Okay, now let us dig little bit deeper, because lot
of questions come in in the first session, so those
questions will be answered by looking at the next part of the
session. So the first part what we are trying to do is we are
trying to understand basically, what is the need of AI, what is
the need of AIML? Why people are adapting AIML like that, and how
did this difference from the classical, traditional
programming. So there you got an idea that, okay, so we are going
to feed data into the model. Model is the data is nothing but
input and output. Middle is generating a kind of function.
That function is used to predict, okay? Once the session
is done, if time permits, I'll show you how the deployment
works with a simple sample code, so you will get a confidence
that okay, models can be deployed without no coding. Also
very simple understanding, okay, POC, how to make those things.
We'll see if possible today or not tomorrow. We'll discuss,
okay. Now, what is the framework? Now the second part
now you understand what is machine learning. Machine
learning is something which is going to take the data and
understand the pattern, generate the function. This is what you
understood. Everybody. This simple takeaway in a minute.
Now, let us dig little bit deeper into what is the
framework actually? What is the we can say that machine learning
framework. So, for example, if you look into this, the function
you are giving an apple inside, okay, so it is saying it's an
apple. When you are giving a tama to tomato, it says it is a
tomato. When you are giving a cow, it is saying a cow. Okay,
so the prediction function we are getting, and on the
prediction function, we are passing some input features.
Okay, so depending upon the feature it is going to give, it
is an apple or tomato or cow, something like that, correct. So
if you keep it in mathematical format, we can say that y is a
our output, f is a prediction function. X is a feature
representation. That means, if you relate with the previous
concepts there I have a flower data where we have sepal length,
sepal width, petal length and petal width. I need to classify
whether it is Setosa virginica varicosa. That is, what do we
call? We call it as a classification problem right now
these four columns are known as a features, and what about this
F? F is the prediction function. Y is our output. This is known
as a y. So whatever the terminology we understood in the
first session, we are trying to elaborate little bit more. Okay,
so now the question is, how do we get this F from? Where we get
x? What is the Y? This is that we are trying to understand.
Okay, so here we will come across with two things. We call
it as a training and testing. These two terms, let me explain
you, for example. What is the training? Training in the sense
just now, in the previous example, we took 0123,
and 1357,
then, we are giving this to a model. Model, understanding the
pattern. Then it is producing the function. So
to understand the pattern, model, what we are doing, it is
going to take these samples as a training data sample, similar,
right? So when you are in the third standard, when mathematics
teacher comes in, she's explaining an example of adding
of three plus four, four plus three, something. They are
examples for you, right? They are training. She is trying
giving a training to you. So once you get the training, once
your brain understands it, it came up with some function in
your brain, right? So testing what he what she is doing now,
she is taking any one of the unseen feature that is four. Now
she's asking. What is the answer? You say that, okay, for
four, answer is nine. So the keeping this unseen data, we
call it as a testing so in our terminology, we can say
something. Let me give you on the whiteboard. So here, y is
equal to f of x, if you elaborate little bit more, F is
the prediction function. X is the feature. Y is our output.
For example, 0123413579,
okay, so this is x and this is y.
Tell me.
It a supervised learning and
unsupervised learning. Supervised Learning,
perfect. Okay. Now here, why is the output? When I say for five,
what is the answer? This, five is a feature. Everybody
agree, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes. Okay. Now when I give this x and
y, x and y, x is how much 01234,
why is 13579,
we got a function f of x, correct. So what is the
function? We got 2x plus one. Now this function is known as a
prediction function. Here, when I keep instead of x5 I'm going
to get how much, how
much I'm going to get 11.
So y is 11. So why can I say, why is the prediction? Yeah,
yes. So this is prediction is how much level. Now this data I
use to give the model, right? So the data which I give is known
as, what do we call this training data?
Now this data I didn't give at the time of training, correct
after training, after generating the function to check the model.
We are using this data. So this is known as a test data,
clear so we have in machine learning algorithms. Now data is
divided into how many parts, two parts. One is the training data,
second is the testing data, okay,
okay, so let us jump into the slides again.
Have you here? I'll take the question just just just a
minute. When I say questions, let us take the questions at
that time. Okay, just little bit patience. Write down your
questions once they say, Okay, come up with the questions. I'll
take all the questions. Okay, can you just go back to the
previous slide please, just to note down the testing.
Yeah, if you have any questions, please just write it down.
When I say
again, ask the questions, then you can Okay, please let us
maintain that way.
Okay. Now these slides will be shared, okay, after the session,
they'll put into the LMS, the video and slides. Everything is
available, okay, for you, don't worry. Now, for example, let us
take a different kinds of problem statements,
what are x and y in span detection, what are x and y in
image detection? What is x and y in sentiment analysis? What is x
and y for anything? So generally, what is the
abstraction here? Abstraction is we have x and y, then we are
going to say what kind of problem statement. So depending
upon the y value, we say, this is supervised learning. Then
depending upon if it is a continuous we can call it as a
regression. If we have some classes, we call it as a
classification. For example, in the spam detection, we know that
everybody know that email is the input. Output is the spam or
ham. Image classification, image pixels are the inputs. Then we
are classifying whether it is a cat or dog two classes. For
example, you can have more, also not a problem, cat, dog, horse
or anything, okay. Sentiment analysis, for example, you have
a text data, then we have a sentiment, whether it is a
positive sentiment or negative sentiment. For example, I say
that movie is very good as a positive sentiment. I say that,
okay, I wasted my time. It is the negative sentiment. So what
is the input? Now, input is the textual data. What is the
output, whether it is a positive sentiment or negative sentiment
like that for every problem statement, what is the
abstraction? Now we need to understand what is x and y, then
put your problem statement, that's it. So for example, we
have x and y for the classification task. We can use
it, or we can use for the regression task. So generally, x
is when you see the x values, they are like a column vectors.
We call it, for example, if you take 01234,
it is in this format. We call it as a column vector. If it is
have something like 01234,
we call it as a row vector. Okay, so then, what about this?
Why? Why is sometime for the classification, it can be zero
or one. Sometimes it can have a multi classes. Also, for
example, we have Setosa virginica varicosa, or something
like that. So features are in a tabular format, and the
particular What do you say the column will be in which format
and row format, and that values will be assigned to these
columns. Actually, okay. So that is the abstract of those thing.
Little bit more if you want to extract the more features, more
understanding. Now we generally call it as y is equal. We call
it as f of.
W and X where W is
hidden. Actually, we don't write W directly. We write X only
where w is nothing, but we call it as a weights. We call them as
a weights. So from where we get these weights. We get the
weights from the data. For example, 0123413579,
we have the equation 2x plus one. Now where two a two is the
weight, okay, one is also a bias. We call it now these two
from where you get these two? Using this data only, right? We
got the slope as y2, minus y1, by x2, minus x1 because we know
that it is a linear equation. So who is giving this W? Data gives
us the W so f of x is the function we are going to find
it. Example, function can be not only linear, it can be a
quadratic, or it can be a polynomial, or it can be
anything, depending upon your problem statement, the function
will vary. So the abstraction, how do we write? Generally we
write. Sometimes we write, wy is equal to f of w and x. So what
is the difference between f of x and w and x? Here you're trying
to mention the weights also. So for example, if your previous
problem, how do you mention the weights? What is the weights? We
have only two correct and the x is the value. So when a
substituting in the equation, we say that weight times of the x,
plus whatever the bias you have. So bias is one. For example,
intercept, we call it. So in machine learning terminology,
the intercept, also known as a bias, we call it as a error code
like that, error value, something like that. Not a
problem. Okay, now, what's the difference between regression
and time
series problems, just simple understanding regression is
predicting a real number. Very simple. What do you mean by
that? Minimum temperature is given five to five? Maximum
Temperature, 20, 3040, something like that. That's known as a
regression like you know, for example, you are predicting the
stock data like, today is the price. What is the price from
the next day that is depending upon the time you are predicting
that is called as a time series data. Now let us dig a little
bit more on the training and testing understanding. Okay, for
example, I have the samples here. So these samples are, for
example, divided into two classes. One is red circles.
Another is the green cross. So the target column consists of
how many classes, two classes, whether it is a supervised
learning or unsupervised learning.
Supervised learning. So let us say this is all zeros and this
is all ones, for example, two classes, okay. Now in these two
classes, we say supervised learning. In supervised
learning, is it a classification or regression? Classification?
Why? Because we have circle, sign, cross marks, two
categories are there. So we call this as a classification
problem. So in the classification problem, what we
are doing, we are using some of the data for the training and
the remaining data we are keeping for a testing what is
the purpose of using the training and testing data?
Because this training data is used to train the model. So once
the model achieves what is f of x, to check model is working
fine or not, we are going to use this unseen data, because this
data is no way used when the model is trained correct. So
that data is known as a unseen data. So we use this unseen data
for what purpose, for understanding whether the model
is performing good or not, okay. I'll give you an example, a
technical example to make you understand. For example, I have
a training data which consists of apples, pears, oranges, cow,
dog and horse, for example. Okay. Now what I want to do, I
want to train the model. This is the training so how many
categories we have, Apple, Pierce, orange, cow, dog and
horse. Is it supervised learning or unsupervised learning?
Supervised?
Is it a classification or regression
classification? So now we have a features. What are the features?
Feature can be, for example, shape is there? Our size is
there are? We can say that color is there are. Is there any
number of legs? Is there something like that? Depending
upon that, we are going to give as a column. Name is we can say
that prediction, what is the prediction we are doing now?
Prediction is whether it is a apple or banana or anything. So
these things are known as a features. Features means the
column names which we are using. Okay, then these features will
be used for the training using the labels. That means these
features in the previous.
Example, with x, what training labels are. Why? Then we did the
training. Training happened. Once the training happened, we
got a
learn model. We call it, okay, what is that? We call the model
which is produced, learn model. So in the previous example, what
is the Learn model? Name prediction function. We write,
say, model, example, right? We didn't put into any we need to
save this model. This is the model. So now I can use this
model. We can say, model dot predict, for example, unseen
data. Tell me what is unseen data we took as a file, correct?
So now, if you take the previous example, what are the features
we have? X is one feature? What is the training levels? Why we
have when training happened? I use which algorithm for
training, linear regression. Then we got the model. What is
the model? Name is the model I got it? Now I use this model to
predict whether given is, what is the output we got? How much
11. So this is training is happening, done. Now this five,
which is not used. So in the training, what we used, 01234,
we used it. And whereas in the y labels, what we used 13579,
so these are used while training, but five we didn't
use, right? So five separate. So we call this as a testing. We
call it clear. So now we got a learned model. So when we see
unseen data, testing how much we are giving now, what is the
feature? We are giving? Five, we are giving as a feature to the
Learn model. So model is taking and doing the prediction. What
is the Learn model here? Model is a learn model. Feature is
five. What is the prediction we got
11. So this process is, what do we call testing? We call it so
first we build the model that is known as a training. Once you
build the model, the model which we are doing prediction is known
as a testing purpose. We use it understood, clear.
Okay.
Now I'll take some of the questions. Please go ahead.
One question on the previous example of apples. Can we go
back to the previous slide?
Precisely belongs to this only. Don't ask advanced questions
like, how things
on the same if I, if I, my problem is, if I want to group
into fruits versus animals, does that become unsupervised
learning? Yes,
yes, perfectly.
Why is it not a classification problem? Because he's trying to
put it in two different groups, roots versus animals, right? You
can give features of fruit. You don't have a label right? Boss,
you don't have a label right?
Fruits, you can eatable, like that. You can label right later,
see if you are putting a label that is supervised again, just
you are grouping, okay. Still, the confusion is around
supervised, unsupervised. Let us do one thing. Let me give you a
brief understanding.
First listen to me, then you have a question. Feature,
supervised learning, unsupervised learning. Feature
is the data in supervised learning? What is the data we
use, input plus output, whereas in on foot for supervised
learning, we use only input, input, we don't have any output.
Next one labels. In supervised learning, labels are present,
Whereas in unsupervised learning
not present, there is no label. Okay, and what is the goal?
Here? Goal is predict
or classify. This is two whereas here group are cluster. This is
the target. Whatever the examples, if you take an example
here, one example is spam detection. For example, given a
mail, we can say whether it is a spam or have price prediction. I
want to predict what is the price of the particular 120,
rupees, 30 rupees, something like that. Whereas in a
unsupervised learning, we call it as a customer segmentation or
a topic discovery, something like that.
Okay, this is the basic difference between a supervised
learning and unsupervised learning. For example, I have a
scenario. Let me give an scenario.
Okay, so I have size and then I have a color. So size is small,
color is red, size is medium and color is yellow, and size is
large, color is green.
Now I do these are the features that is input. You don't have
any target. That means, if it is the apple or orange or banana or
anything, I don't have any.
Target. When I give this data algorithm, what it will do,
depending upon the small with the red color, it will create
one cluster. Medium with yellow color, it will create another
cluster.
Then we have a large with green, it will create another cluster,
like these three clusters. These clusters doesn't have any
labels, okay. So what we can do is, later, I just give you an
example. Later, as a subject matter expert and human being,
you see that, okay? After the grouping, I can give a label so
small and red, I can say them as a apple and medium and yellow.
For example, I can say this as a banana, and when it is a large
and green, I can say something like a watermelon. Now, when you
give a label, this unsupervised learning combination of label is
known as a semi supervised so these things, these two things,
in coming sessions, in detail we'll discuss. Okay, so my
request is you people just try to understand up to this part.
Don't dig deeper, because in the deeper, in the coming sessions,
we are going to discuss the basic difference and everything
clear. Now make yourself supervised learning.
Unsupervised Learning clear first, so there is only input
and output. Supervised Learning, only input. Is there?
Unsupervised learning? Here we have a labels. Yes, no labels,
what we are going to do in supervised learning, predicting
and classifying whether as an unsupervised learning, either we
group them or cluster them. That's it. Where is the
confusion? Still, I think the key thing that we think there is
a confusion about is that whether the label is a part of
the problem statement or not. So if it's not part of the problem
statement, then it is
then it is unsupervised learning. If it is a part
statement, then it is supervised learning. You can create labels,
but it does. If it doesn't come with the problem statement, that
means it is unsupervised to begin with, exactly good
understanding, yes, no one. What's the question? Yeah. So
the question, there are two things. The first thing is, like
the label in supervised learning, the above example, or
classification, the table, their output is the label right for
supervised case, yeah. Okay, so thank you. And then in the
machine learning framework.
So the first thing that you explained is that y equal to f
of x, right? So there you talked about column vector and a table,
column matrix and the table, right?
So in a thing, in a linear equation, function, like how the
table came in, is what I'm trying to understand,
how the table? What is the table? Boss? You people are
diverting yourself. Don't keep in that. You know, come
confusion, linear regression or logistic regression, or super
support vector machine, anything. Don't worry. We are
giving one of the column, getting the with the target. It
is a supervised learning. That column is known as a feature.
That's it. You know, that feature understood now,
yeah, satisfied, yeah, okay, that's it. Now, don't get how we
are getting, you know, that columns that is subject matter
expert is providing us. So we are taking it. We are spreading
which features we need to take. All those things in coming
sessions, as a data scientist, will take a decision, but
today's session, just understand, what is the feature
is? What is the role of feature? What is the role of target
column? That's it clear. Okay, thank you.
Yeah, next one.
Okay, so let me take some questions, sir, are these
algorithms too complex we can implement to into hardware or
login or a chip. Okay, I'm from real estate. Yes, it is Pawan.
It is a classical machine learning algorithms. Even deep
learning algorithms are very simple. You can nowadays, we can
deploy into the chips. Also look like testing data volume is low
compared to the training set. Slush, one drop. We are
generally testing data samples are very less. We'll just take
it only the training data sample in the huge size. So generally,
the split is 8020, we call it. We can go up to 6040, also.
Okay, so we'll see that now. Okay, so now the split, how
split will happen. I'll show you see,
for example, let us take the same data. Okay, so here the
previous example only. Let me take up this question. This this
example.
Okay, now, let me add some more examples, five and six. Now, for
five, how much we'll
get,
and for six, six to 12 plus 113, correct? This is we got it.
Okay. So once you get this, I need to split them into training
and testing.
Once you are completed with question, please mute yourself.
Okay, thank you. Here we'll take from a scale on
dot.
Uh, model, underscore, selection. We use train and
test. Script, one function,
okay, we have x and we have y correct. So what I will do now,
x, underscore, train X, underscore, test, why?
Underscore, train y, underscore. Test is equal, train underscore,
test, underscore split x and y.
Test underscore size is equal to 0.2,
and random. Underscore state is equal to for example, let me
take something around 42 something like that.
Okay,
now we got a linear regression. LR is equal to
linear regression
here. LR dot fit X, underscore train, y, underscore train.
We got the answers now what I will do Y, bread is equal to LR,
dot predict X, underscore test I will do.
Okay.
Now DF, one is equal.
Let me do one thing, just put it in a format code,
so speedy, DF is equal to P dot data frame.
Why test is y by pretty is y printing DF.
Okay, so let us do one thing. First of all, see, step by step,
I like strain now. Okay, so how is our data? Now?
Just be with me. Nothing to panic. Very simple. Our data, we
have x and y, 0123456,
we took up to six. How much? How many
sample speed tips. Tip? Six, correct?
Then, what is the
why? Why is 13579,
1113,
it is seven sample right? Actually,
yeah, seven samples here.
Okay, now come
again. Start from zero the second
seven samples, yeah. So what I'm going to do now here this x and
y, right?
So this is x and this is y. Now this x part, I'm going to divide
into two parts.
This is known as a x train.
This is known as a X test. Then coming to y, I split this as a y
train and white test.
Now tell me. I said, there are seven samples. I said, 20% I
said, keep it for testing. 80% I said, keep it for training. So
out of seven, 80% means how many samples will come into training?
Tell me six, 5.65
so approximately six are five, for example. Okay, so here let
us print those things. We'll see
x train and y train. So when you say x, underscore train,
how many samples we got, 52436,
this one, then coming to x under Support test,
how many samples we got? 01 so 01 came into
01 are in the testing? Correct?
Yes or no, yes. Okay, what about the training? Tell me whatever
training. 552,
yeah, right. 34346, 23234346346,
now, if you see the data is randomly split, it right, right,
not in the sequence. Why? Because here I mentioned that
random state is equal to 42 means after 42 times of
shuffling whatever the data you are getting, give me the data
then the test size. I said, Keep how much 20% as a test size
remaining as a training size. You can see it is keeping 20% as
a test size remaining as a training set. Now this five, how
much we got the output as a 11 for two, how much we got
five for three, seven
for 0113,
for one, three. Okay, now what I did is, I'm taking this extreme
data and I'm taking this white train.
Data and feeding to the model. Agree, right? I said X,
underscore train. And then I said, y, underscore train.
Feeding into the model. Model is generating one function everyone
is up to. This is clear. Everyone, yes, yes. Okay, now to
test my model, what I did is I kept some samples aside, 01, and
zero. I didn't use them in the training. Everybody agree? Okay,
what I did is up to this. Okay, clear. That means here in the
training part, what I did is very simple. I said, Okay,
train, the Model X train and y train. Model is trained. Now I
want to check how model is performing. What I did is, okay,
great, work.
Me, can you mute yourself,
please, once you have done with the questions, please mute
yourself, because cohort is a large size. Let us not, you
know, disturb others. Okay, everyone.
How did we arrive? 42 shuffles randomly. Amit. No need to write
42 you can write your lucky number, any lucky number. You
can write it, 123, anything, not a problem. Okay. Now, does
always test data need to be part of input data? Yes, always the
similar means the features must be similar, actually.
Now you can see up to this, everybody is clear, because what
I did is I just trying to train the model. After training the
model, what I did vibrate. I'm taking x test. X test means I am
taking 01 and then I got the prediction. So for this 01
we when I give this 01 to my model, I got the answers or not.
I got the answers or not? Yes, yes. So what are the answers? I
got for 0113,
I got for one, I got one for three. I got how much three
correct or not? Sorry for one. I got for zero. I got one for one,
I got three for example. Okay, so when I get these two, what I
will do is, now I'll compare, okay, I got zero for 01, I got
three. Then I will compare this with the actual
answers I have with me, right? So for zero, I got one, correct
for one, I got three. I also got three. Model says the answer
said three. So that means, can I say my model is 100% accurate?
Yeah,
yes, yes or no. So now no need to worry about the accuracy, but
understand what is the role of testing and training. So what is
the role of training? Training is to make the model to
understand the pattern, and we are keeping some of the answers
aside and we test them correct. So it is something like when you
are attending an exam, I am giving you a sample questions,
and when you are reading through the questions, I am going to
give you unsealed questions and ask the answers. I know the
answers right? So whatever the answers you are giving and the
answers which I kept, I know I'm going to compare. If those
answers are correct, I'm going to give you 100% marks. If not
correct, I'm going to decrease the marks correct. So that is
what a training and testing means. So training in the sense,
what is the purpose of training? Training is to train the model,
to get the function. Once get the function, to deploy the
model, we need to have a sample testing. So how do we do that
testing part? We are doing the testing part by taking the
testing data, which kept aside correct so this is what the
experiment is trying to explain what is training and testing.
Okay, so I'll unmute. I'll give a chance to ask the questions
for five minutes. Anybody have a questions? Please go ahead.
Yeah. One by one, raise your hands, and in the sequence,
Aditi, go ahead, sir. The question is right now around the
training part, sir, in case of supervisor, do we always pick up
some set of algorithms we feed to the system to understand the
behavior of the output that, given that we know the output so
is the
training algorithm has to be there for us to be able to
identify, I mean, to understand the output pattern. Sir.
You mean to say that in supervised learning. Now, don't
worry about the supervised learning. It's completely
supervised learning only. Don't use the term supervised
learning. We are under supervised learning only. Okay
today, completely. So in the supervised learning, we are
taking the features and then we have a target column correct. So
features to get the target column, giving it to your model
makes understand the pattern. Once the pattern understood, we
are going to check whether the pattern is correct or not by
keeping some samples aside. That is what testing clear,
sir, this when we are identifying these patterns. Sir,
as I said, this is where the question is that, what is the
another?
You define how to identify that pattern. Are the algorithms fit
in, or how we are algorithm will take care of those things. We
are not going to have any interference with that. So,
okay, after I did, for example, I use linear regression. Okay,
so it identified a pattern. When you're giving input, we got the
answer. All the answers are correct. 100% accurate.
Accuracy. You got it good to go. No need to go with another
algorithm. If you are getting less algorithms, for example,
less accuracy, then we'll go with another algorithm. Okay,
simple hit enter, and that's it. No need to understand that
internal pattern, how it is working, and all those things
clear. Aditi, so
I think I was just trying to understand that, is it mandatory
to give a give some algorithms to the model? Right? To
understand the pattern isn't is that a current understanding?
Yeah, you have to give the model. Model algorithm is
nothing but a model only, right if you don't give a model. Who
is going to train?
Yes, yes. So as a maybe related question, but probably you also
for then understand that how to derive these models, right, sir.
I mean, no need to derive the model. Aditi, we just use the
model. So you need to see how the model works. That is what
data scientist job is. Okay.
Okay, yeah. Anubhav, what's the question? Please, go ahead. I
just wanted to understand that weightage you have mentioned in
the PPT, the weightage. I need some examples to understand that
weightage point. Why? Nothing but the coefficient is known as
the term we use as a weightage, okay, the coefficient is itself
in machine learning. We call it as a weights. We call it okay.
That is for example, intercept is there, right? So, intercept
is the coefficient those things we call it as a weights.
Okay, okay,
yeah,
okay. Ramesh, go ahead, yeah, we are fit to pass the test rate
and to see the outcome, but to compare the test data result and
the prediction result,
right? What was the function we have used? We don't use any
function for that. Actually, we use LR, dot score here, right
directly. Previously, there is what do you call
mean square error, mean average error, but now that is before
skl on 1.2 version, but now latest version of Sklar, in
order to arrive at main square error and all those things,
directly you can check the score. It is going to give you
the percentages. Okay, so if you're getting 100% means one
means 100 percentage you're getting, that means the model is
good to go in the production. Okay, so previously, little bit
confusion on how do you find the mean square or mean average
error, then compare with the models and all those things. But
luckily, with the latest, more, latest version of the scale and
score is enough for us. Okay. Okay, so there is no need to use
the predict. In this case, no need to use predict, just
directly. Just for understanding, I have shown the
Predict directly. We can use LR, dot score, that's it. Okay,
yeah. Kiran, what's the question? I think you just
answered it. Mean, I was just trying to understand, what is
the the error, or what is the score of the model? Yeah, okay,
okay, okay, done in detail. We have one in chapter number two.
We'll discuss about accuracy, all those things. So don't need
to worry. Okay. Priyanka,
hi. I just need to understand in the train test split function,
what does random state equal to 42 mean, very good question.
Random state is something? Did you take a session on NumPy?
Everybody in Python, when you're taking Python, did you take a
session NumPy? Anything? Yes.
In NumPy, we use random seed right.
Random Seed to generate random numbers. Correct? Yes, yes, yes,
yeah. So it is something remember, like, you know, we
have some sample data here. What is that sample data like? For
example, 01234567,
is the sample data, right? Keep that sample data into a box.
Shuffle that box 42 times. After 40 times, throw it then it will
put into how many parts, two part training and testing. So
80% will fall into training, remaining 20 parts fall into
testing. So that shuffling is known as 42 that means 42 times
I'm shuffling the model. If you write one one time you're
shuffling, that's it. How many times you want you can shuffle.
So the more you shuffle it, the more the value of random state,
the more Yes, we have the data randomly placed, and randomness
will be increasing when you are increase the number, but we have
only seven sample, only two. Randomness also is good. But
generally we have millions of samples in real world, right?
That is where, oh god, thank you. Perfect. No problem.
Welcome Chaitanya. What is the question Chaitanya? So when
we're saying sample,
if you can go back to the collab ones,
okay,
yeah, so the test train split. Now when we say random, random
state equal to 42 every time we execute it, it will randomly
pick any two, any 20% as a test data. It.
It's not always the same data that that is.
Yeah, here is the same data. 42 shuffle will be same data. If
you don't give this random state, then shuffling will be
randomly done anything every time, every time you execute,
you'll get different samples. Oh, here we if we mentioned
random,
the test data will always say how many hours, essentially,
yes, yes. See, for example, if I execute this, it will be same,
okay. If I remove this strain, random state, this data will
vary because we are not fixing right, so automatically,
according to its wish it is doing. Now, for example, split
now extreme will get some different patterns, some
different like that. So that is the reason, because when you are
building the model and when you are showing to the stakeholder,
you need to get a different for example, when without random
state, you got 80% when you are presenting you got 20% only.
That is the confusion. Stakeholder will reject your
models, right? So that is the reason we keep random state here
to get the same accuracy always. Okay,
okay, yeah, good. So just pass from the questions. Let me take
some questions in the chat box. Can the test data fade to the
model to find if your answer is in the chat box, please. You
can, you know, just
okay,
lower your hand. Can the test data free to model, to fine tune
the model further? No, it is not fine tune the model. Just it is
to check the performance. Okay. Fine tuning is a different word.
Okay. Fine tuning is something. If the model is not working
good, we are trying to make it working good by using some
parameters or those things. So Ramesh, be careful. The
terminology, fine tool we don't use that is parameter fine
tuning. In advanced sessions, we'll discuss that. Okay, so
test data is just for to testing whether model is performing well
or not. Okay. Now coming to is there any possibility of giving
option to the machine learning choose whether to take a linear
regression otherwise, without us giving a lead? Prabhakar, we
don't have an option of like something machine learning
itself. It can do it. But now we have a package known as auto ml.
So when you give a problem statement auto ml itself, the
package itself will decide whether it is a classification
problem or regression. According to that, it will apply five to
six algorithms your choice. Then you can choose any one which is
the top priority. So that is, I can just give you. We call it as
a auto ml, you can search this is we'll discuss in chapter
number four. Okay,
so this is auto ml, we call it so like automatically, it is
going to take care of, you know which are. So every day by day,
the job of data scientist is becoming very easy. Okay, how do
you know testing outcome is accurate or less accurate? The
Jay Raju, we have the sample data with us, right the answers,
we'll compare with that. So if the answers are very nearer,
then we say it's good to go. So that is where we use the score.
Okay?
Then we have, I think we need to some example. Take check the
Yeah. Jai Raju, we are not today. We are not checking with
the accuracies today. The session is just to what is train
split and test split accuracies will come into the unit two when
we are discussing fine tuning the algorithms and all those
things. Okay,
algorithm or model is written by data scientist. Aditi. Very good
question. It is a part of research, okay? PhD scholars,
they will write it. Data scientist is the one he's
consuming. Okay? Data scientist is not the one. So PhD people,
they are contributing to the community with the coming up
with a new research. Okay, next one? Can anybody? Can anyone
share the link? Okay, definitely. I'll share the link.
Don't worry. How to compare prediction results and test data
programmatically, those things we'll discuss in coming
sessions. So we are not supposed to, you know, do today's session
by LR. Score will work for us. Okay, accuracy score, we call
it, and we need to find mean square error. So there is a
matrix in scale on we'll use that. Okay, x and y are shuffled
together or independently together. They will suffer
independent if they shuffle. The label will be changed, right?
That's where, and that data will be shuffled. Okay. Pavan, okay,
good for a different data. Score depends on random state, right?
How do you find optimum training data? Very good question. Site
edge. So to get the best optimum, we are going to use on
top of our algorithm. We call it as a optuna is one of the
library we use it, or we use grid search CV, which can give,
suggest that, okay, this is the best training split, and these
are the best parameter for two, also, or something it can give
us, okay,
next one. What is the importance of random state? Is it
mandatory? It's not mandatory. She but the problem is like, if
you don't give a random state, the shuffle will be every time
different. And when you are presenting in front of a
stakeholder, that I got a 90% accuracy when you're presenting
a stakeholder due to this randomness, accuracy may go
down. Okay, so that is the reason we put the fixed size
next one. If model has more data, model is more accurate?
Yes, definitely. So how do you judge your model? One thing is,
the data must be very good, curated. And how.
More number of samples if you are giving there is a
possibility of getting more accuracy. Okay, good question.
Does it matter which part of the data is used for training versus
testing? It doesn't matter. We are joined, just splitting it.
You can randomly. You can select it. Not a problem. Okay, next
one. Narendra, if the data is huge in millions, the random
state should be given lower number, will it have an impact
on performance when the random state is given on higher data,
nobody can judge not seem blue, depending upon the data, the
type of data you have, and the how the data is integrated with
the with each other, okay, on depending upon that, we are
going to decide the random state. If data scientist is
training model, what does machine learning engineer is
doing? Okay, very good question. I'll answer that question.
Tirupati, autoiml, just pinged at this moment of time. We do
not know to worry about all those things. Perfect. Hello,
sir. Where we can see chapter list we so we know which topic
is planned. It is the complete global document. I think we are
going to share there you have please explain test size 0.2 0.2
in the sense it is 20% of testing, 80% is remained for the
training. Okay, okay. Prawan, okay. Thank you. Pramodhini,
thank you. Any best practice by choosing training data, test
data. AIML, this is completely on you. According to your
resources, you can take 8020, or 6040, that is completely a hit
and run. Nobody can say you know this much fixed one. What is why
train, sir, white train is why part we are splitting into two
parts, right? White train and white test, spreading into two
parts, extra and X test. We are keeping x test and extra, extra
white test for a side and just we are giving extreme advisory
to train the model. Okay, so I have answered all the questions
in the chat box.
Do we also have validation data that is, again, don't get into
that advanced topics of validation data that is careful
in the coming sessions, we'll discuss that. Okay, yeah, just
understand training and testing, not simply tell me what's your
question. When the random state value is higher, does it have
impact on the performance of
No, that doesn't have any impact on the performance. By the time
we don't use the model, the model is already executed and we
ready for the job, right? Yes, exactly. So, model already what?
Okay, let me do one thing
to explain you something. Okay, let us do one thing. This is
your model. Okay. So here we have a model, for example. This
is a model. Once you have completed your question, please
mute yourself. Okay, sure.
So this is the model, okay, so let us do one thing.
So you see here, just we have only one sample data. Okay, what
I will do now,
import job, live.
Job live, dot dump.
For example. I'll write down here,
hobby model.
Okay. Now, this is the,
this is the model which I write, right? So if you see here, there
is a model known as happy model, correct.
Who did this? Who trained the model? Think I am the data
scientist. Okay, what I did, I took the data. I do the model.
Now I need one person to deploy, so we call it as ml ops
engineer. Generally, they do the job. I'll just discuss the loans
roles. Are those things after this session, okay? So now what
I will do, I'll download the model here, download the model.
Okay, model downloaded. Now in this I will upload the model.
Now, upload the model. For example. This is the model I
have.
Okay, just let me rename it.
Okay. Now, here what I will do, import, sorry,
import job lab,
then
model is equal.
Job lip, dot load, what is our model? Name?
Happy, model Correct.
Yes or no, yes.
Okay, now I say model dot
predict
by
see we got the answer or not. So this the way we consume the
models. This will done by your side. As a data scientist, you
train the model. Just give this model, after training people,
what they will do. Just use the model and predict here random
state everything doesn't know. Nothing works already. We did
the random state part. Everything here only, right?
That is how models will be consumed, understood. So all
these are all pre compiled state. So that's okay, okay.
Extension, okay, similar to libraries,
similar to library for example, if you say no, I want to show
them POC, for example, okay, POC in real time, no.
Some models only, deep learning models have extension, but here,
no need to give an extension, okay. Now, can we look into
details of the each model algorithm understand details,
like in other functions, we write no power one, it is a
black box. How is data split in? When data keeps arriving, like
streaming data, that is omarani got continuous learning. We call
it, okay? So that is, we need to write a pipeline whenever data
comes in, using a GitHub actions will do that. Okay, generally,
what is random state like? How many times I'm telling you,
people, random state is something like, you're shuffling
the data. That's it. Okay. How many times you're shuffling?
Think like you have some of the cards in a box. You're shuffling
42 times, and then you're throwing that number you are
wish you can set into 1012, anything? Not a problem. Okay?
Okay, great. Now, for example, generally, okay, first, let us
take some questions. Then I'll show you real time how things
will happen. Simple, POC, I'll show you, okay, that is not
needed today, but to avoid the confusion. Okay, so now tell me
end of the day. What did you understand now we are having
some of the samples as a trainee, some of the samples we
are taking as a from the input feature, some of the samples and
output features, some of the samples we are taking and giving
it to training, and it is going to give us the weights, so that
weights is nothing, but we are going to say 2w plus, sorry, w
times of x plus any bias, we can add it. So how much we got? In
the previous example, we got w as a two. So we can say that 2x
plus one intercept is something like that. We got it now. What
are the terminology? Totally today's section, you need to
understand. First thing is ground truth. Ground Truth means
the actual value is known as a ground truth, okay,
means, for example, there is a label known as a spam that is
known as a ground rule. Now you got a answer, also spam that is
known as the label. What we got it so, ground truth and labels
both are same. Some people, they say ground truth. Some people
say that labels. So, terminology same. Some people will say that
predictions. So the prediction column can be known as a ground
truth. Labels and predictions both all three are similar. What
is the training and testing? When you have bunch of data, you
are taking some of the data and giving it to model training
them. That is one of the training you are keeping some of
the samples aside to test the model, whether the model is
doing good or not, okay. Now, what is the supervised learning?
Target column? Is there supervised learning? No target
column, unsupervised learning. So now, what is the features?
Features is something which is defining our target column,
okay, depending upon the features we are going to get.
What is the target? What is the input? Input? You know that
features are known as the input. Output is the why the target
column is known as a output, feature representation means,
how do you write the features in the column? Presentation samples
the features and the target completed together all those
things we call it as a samples. What is the learning model? We
got the learning model here. What is the learning model here?
Hobby model is the learning model, right? So here we got one
model, happy model. This is a learn model. We call it finally
last term is the classification. What is the classification? If
the target column consists of discrete values, whether it is
Setosa virginica, binary classification, multi class
classification, we call it as a what
do you call? We call it as a classification. Okay, so that
means, overall, you are in the second half of the session. You
need to understand what is the feature? Feature is nothing, but
we call it as a input. Columns are known as feature. Everybody
agree?
Yes, sir, yes, yes. What is the output? Output is nothing but
label can be continuous
or
discrete. Continuous is what do we call?
Regression? Regression
discussion, what do you call? Okay, then we said, what is a
train? Train means out of this samples, some part we are taking
it as a training. Some part we are taking it as a testing, so
which is under X, we call it as A x train, which is under X, we
call it as x test, which is under why? We call it as a white
train, which is under why we call it as a y test. Okay, so
this part we use for training and this part we use for
testing. Testing. So before training, what do we do? We do
shuffle. How do you shuffle?
We use which parameter, random state, how much, whatever your
lucky number.
100 101, 20. You can give it not a problem. Okay, this is about
the training and testing. So if you understand these things,
that means 100% you understood the today's session. That's it.
These are the takeaways. No need to find about the accuracies and
all those things. In the coming sessions, we are going to
discuss and all those things. So in other terminology, if you put
it, we got the input that is known as the features, then we
got the output, which is known as the labels given to the
model. We got a learn model. Now, as a data scientist, you
need to understand what is the model, learn model. And this
one, okay, clear.
Now here,
like people, they say that, what is the role of a data scientist?
How it is going to streaming data? A lot of questions, right?
For example, I want to build a model which can take a data from
Twitter,
Facebook,
YouTube, blah, blah, blah, something. I want to classify
about a movie. I'm talking about a movie, I want to say whether
it is a positive sentiment or negative sentiment. So from all
those things, I'm collecting the data correct. We are collecting
the data, then this data will be converted into meaningful
format, meaningful format, and after that we are going to use
this do analysis. Then after that, we build the model, build
the model, then we deploy the model. This is the life cycle of
the aim algorithm. So what is the data here we are getting
about the hashtag of the movie. We are getting the data. For
example, if the movie XYZ, movie is good, movie is not good,
blah, blah, blah, blah, we got it. So what we are going to do
now we are going to convert into a tablet format saying that this
is a pass to sentiment, negative, sentiment like that.
So we have a text, and then we have a label, positive or
negative. So now we have one person is going to give
graphically, is going to present, how is the data? And
then he is the one. He is building the model, and then he
is deploying now the person who is working up to this is known
as a data engineer, the person who is giving a visualization,
we call it as a data analyst. Now, the person who is building
the model this known as AI engineer, or ml engineer, the
person who is deploying the model, known as ml ops engineer.
Now, the person who is having the complete knowledge is known
as a data scientist. So these are the basic roles in industry,
is looking at Clear,
understood Can you please elaborate more on ml engineer
versus data scientist? Data
scientist is the person. We can say he is a principal person who
is having a knowledge of data acquisition, data analysis,
visualization, building the model, deploying of the models.
This is the whole person, right? So when you're joining a big
company, they have a different roles. They don't let you, if
you're a data engineer, they don't put you in the ML engineer
part. So just that, they you must be taking the data from
data lakes, dumping into a place, converting them into
relational databases. Then the analyst will consume the data.
He will visualize the data using matplotlib, C bond, like that,
and the data ml. Engineer is going to build the models like
using linear regression, logistic regression, depending
upon the analysis and visualization. Finally, the
model will be deployed into the cloud. People will consume the
model. These are the different roles are available. Okay,
clear, like while deploying, what kind of skills
requirements, what of tools? What kind of tools will be you
need to have an understanding of a Docker Kubernetes and ml flow,
okay, those things, depending upon the models you are using,
gen ed or a classical machine learning model, you need to use
different tools. Okay,
so after this, course, we will have, we can target any of these
positions depending Exactly. So, yeah, something like given you
different kinds of sweets in front of you, whichever you like
it. You can take it, and you can, you know, work towards
that. But end of the day, you will be a data scientist. Okay,
you will have all the techniques, okay, okay, yeah.
Those things are separate, so they will when you are taking
that project is the right capstone project at the time,
deployment will be taught. I'm going to teach you the first
aid. How do you convert interest, API, consume that.
I'll teach that. Okay. Thank you. That targeting job we
should do aim for a data scientist. Then whichever role
will fit, company will allow assign to us
exactly so.
Our target is, first is data scientist role, okay, we must be
very good at all those things, okay. Later onwards, according
to your you know, like, for example, you are very good at
visualizing. You can get into data analyst role. If you are
working as getting into startup company which is highly paid,
then you have to be proficient in all those things. You don't
have separate roles. All single role will play all those things.
Okay, okay. So do we have any priorities are like data
scientist will be high priority, and AIML model engineer will be
low priority, like that. Something do we have in the
industry? No, that will completely with experience. For
Mr. Jana, everybody have a similar kind of pay, but that
with experience only. Okay. Okay, sir. Thank you. Yeah,
two boxes, sorry, from this, this model and the next one is
design.
Come again, come again. Explain the diagram once again. So
quickly. I mean
the what is the question? So, can you explain the diagram once
again, sir, the role parts the data. Then what is another data?
Cleaning meaningful data. This five boxes, yeah, okay. First of
all is taking the data, ingesting into data like we call
it, okay, first part. Second part is converting that into
meaningful format. Means, according to data scientist
format, relational database are structured like that. Then this
is the data analyst part, who is going to take this meaningful
data, building the visualization. Okay, then the
model part is going to build by AIML engineer, or machine ml
engineer. We call it our data engineer. We call a lot of roles
will be there, okay. Finally, deployment is ml ops. You need
to have an understanding of ml ops, okay,
so the data analyst, where you said the visualization can be,
should always be a curves, or it can be some kind of a meaningful
data.
It can always kind of meaningful data is the person is going to
give, finally, a meaningful data to the data, you know, ml
engineer, so that can be like again, curves and graphs and
those kind of things, yeah, everything visually, he can show
to the stakeholder, whether to move on or not, something like
that. Okay, okay, so let us take in the sequence the as the rise,
they raise the hands, right? So Manu Kumar, please go ahead.
Okay, it seems Manu is not there. Ramey the Ramesh Babu,
please go ahead.
Yeah. I have question regarding the random so along with extreme
data, right, we are also passing random. So how that will impact
the outcome? Predict outcome,
because the remain the same, right? So what is the user it's
but for this data, it doesn't have impact. But when you have
huge amount of the data, understanding of the pattern
will vary, right? Due to the shuffling at the time you have a
but here today's session, don't worry about the random state.
You need to concentrate on training and testing. Okay, so
that random state will be in accuracy. When we are discussing
about the accuracy of the models at that time, we'll discuss more
on that clear. Okay, then we'll talk about it later. Yeah, okay.
Uh. Bharat Jai Kumar, what's the question? Please?
Yes, sir. In sir, earlier days, we used to have in software
developed industry, we used to have one content writer, one
designer, one programmer, then one tester. But now, after the
advent of AI, we are having only one person who is designing, who
is testing, who is writing content, everything. So how
affecting the role of the skilled up data science like
still do have different roles. Or one man is handling
everything.
One man handling a one man show never works. Okay? So. And
another thing, what you are saying is one man is taking
documentation all those things is it's not doing industry.
Okay? Industry doesn't follow those rules. So everybody
capability does different. So when you're talking to the
stakeholder, taking the problem, converting that into RFP, then
putting that into the technical, tech stack, all those things
architecture will do, and then lot of roles are there, okay, so
the perception of that AI comes in, it will take all the things,
and only single person can do it is not possible. But the person
who is having and full stack knowledge of a data science,
even he doesn't have an UI, he can take the help of a chat GPT
or some other models. He can build the UI for POC purpose
only, proficiently. He cannot build definitely, we need some
help of the UI people. Okay, so that is where so still, it is
not something like complete one person is replacing all the
jobs. No way. Okay, okay,
sir. Thank you very much. Yeah. Siddharth, go ahead with your
question.
No question. Jaipal,
yes, sir, the year data engineer role, you said right that they
will write the programs right, like extract, using
extract and cleansing and loading it exactly.
Yeah. Mayuri,
no, actually, I do ask.
So in the diagram that you're actually displaying on the
screen, so you're the data, making the data meaningful is
the step before you give it to AI model. Wouldn't those steps
also be part of the result of what you're trying to present to
the stakeholders? As an example, because the model may not give
you in the form that you are looking for, or does a model
give you all the time and supervised learning,
I think my completely depends upon your company, how they are
organizing the roles. Okay, so as I said, in the startup
company, they can do that. As a data scientist, you have to own
each and every part and do it. Suppose, if you are getting into
Accenture or something big companies like, you know,
Google, or somebody, they are fixed roles. You have to do that
part. You don't know. You don't have a visibility of the next
part. Okay, so the completely hidden. So that's where, when
you are coming to the stakeholder generalist, up to
the stakeholders will go up to the data analysis, only
visualization, only the stakeholders will understand how
is the pattern. This one is understanding the pattern. These
are the impacting then the new roles came in, into the industry
now that is known as a ml explainability and ml
understandability, ml observability, is there. So
those things in last sessions, we'll discuss those things. So
here today's session, just simple roles we are discussing,
okay, okay, because I thought the data scientists will be
helpful before and after the AI work as well. So Exactly, yeah,
okay, makes sense, yeah. Priyanka, go ahead with your
question. Yeah, one follow up question. How does data
scientist role is different from Ai Solution Architect? Role?
See AI Solution Architect is the person who must have knowledge
of a micro services, building and state machine buildings. And
how do you build a control panels? And how do you, you
know, build the flow with the existing those things will add
it up with AI. That is Solution Architect, we call it AI, okay,
it is system level things you need to understand. So system
design plus center. Data Scientist, yeah, that is the
he's the solution architect, yeah. Okay, thank you.
Neha Malik, so Sir, in my organization, we did the White
coding. The only difference of opinion I have is in feature
engineering, right? That is something that needs domain
knowledge. So may move out of data engineer and more into a
data scientist or a consultant. That was the only difference in
the whiteboarding we did like feature engineering is more of a
subject matter knowledge that lot of data engineers may not
have, so that gets a domain area, right? So that's the only
difference. Otherwise, our whiteboarding was same as yours,
exactly, correct? Yeah. Correct,
come on,
doctors, just a generic feedback. I think we are kind of
digressing away from what we are trying to learn, because these
discussions are unbounded,
and we can do this probably at the end, as to how end only.
This is a completed session, completed. Come on, that's for
it. Oh, is it? That's it? Okay, yeah, I understood your concern.
That's what I took at the end. Only, okay, this is the end of
the session than today's session. That's what I said,
Actually, no problem. Don't worry. Okay, so, thanks, Kumar,
what's the question? Kumar, please go ahead.
Okay. Kumar, Aditi, once you are done to your question, please
lower your hands. It is confusing me. Like, how many
people are there? Yeah, sorry. Can
you just take one example from practical life to explain these,
from one problem statement, how these five roles will come to
picture, sir to definitely. Aditi, once you are completing
your unit four, at the time, we'll discuss those things,
okay? Because in the beginning session only, all those things
will be totally confusing.
Okay, I'll take that. Don't worry. So now, Jane
said, you mentioned, right, these micro services, and also,
will it be covered in this course
later? Actually, the system design is not included. So micro
services, when you're doing your cohort, you know the capstone
project at the time, our team will discuss, okay, okay, yeah.
Sarkar.
DPM. Sarkar, no question, yeah,
hi. So
I have one question, just, just clarification on the abstraction
part you had explained.
If you can
just, you know, maybe clarify the abstraction part.
Like, what is that abstraction part You mean to say this? Yes,
yes, yes, yes. Just Yes.
Before that, I think, yeah, this and
yeah. So I just wanted to understand the definition by
here. What do you mean by abstraction here?
Abstraction is like, we can say that a framework, orally
generic. How do you present generally? So we can say that we
need to take the input, output features to get.
Answer. And if you're predicting the function that is your
problem statement, that is we are trying to just explain
clear,
okay.
Okay, done. Okay, let us take some of the questions.
Do we have a role of full stack developer in AI also, yes, it is
there. Data scientists, we call it. We have the roles,
description, knowledge and PPT, not there, but I'll include
that. Okay, I later, I'll include all those roles and
everything. Neha Malik, in my anishina, we did whiteboarding
and understanding. Ba AIC, all those things. Thanks for
sharing, but it will be confusing, Neha, once. I'll take
it up at the time. If you're sharing. That will very helpful
for them. Okay, in the beginning session only, we'll get
confused. So actually, there is a simple architect. Architecture
is there, like, you know, roles? Actually, I thought of showing
you people, but you will get confused once you are getting
into advanced session at the time, I'll show you those
things. Okay? It is from like, you know, these are the roles
anyway. I'll mention all those roles in coming sessions. So to
get the clarity, let us not make the session more confusing.
Okay.
Next question is, in the chat box, will be learning on how to
create learn model and Python, as we are showing happy model,
yes. Anubha definitely will do that question. If the data is
not clean, well, will the random cause model give a different
scores, definitely. So that is the reason we say that whenever
you are building the model, data cleaning is the first part
curated data. Okay, we'll do that. You are going to have an
hands on session how to curate the data. So how ml ops are
different from DevOps operation, as we'll use the pipeline ml
ops, see, very simple DevOps people are generally they are
doing with the Java and all those things. Whereas ml ops
people, they need to have an knowledge of AI models, how they
work and all those things. Okay, so to target the research role,
do we need to have any degree in math? A ground truth? No, no
need. No need to have any degree. So suppose, if you are a
bachelor, also, if you want to do some research and something,
or you want to collaborate with me, you can come up, come up
with your problem statement, definitely, I'll guide you.
Okay, next one ground to different from Target, no, no,
both are same, okay, regarding the roles, what language and
skills fit in each role. Kumar, definitely, once you are
completing your AI course, that AIML course, definitely, we are
going to have a session on that. We are going to discuss all
those rules. Okay, can you please share into about a
product manager role, definitely. Will you share this?
Today's theory, practical, explanation of today's session?
PPT, everything will be shared. J quality, okay, even the notes
which I discussed that will be shared. Okay, so my email entry
is Habib, dot v at the rate, talent, sprint.com,
okay.
So Srinivas, what's that question?
Hi,
I need a suggestion. Actually, I'm working in automotive
industry. We are working on few projects, but need a suggestion,
a generic question. So we have lot of vehicle test data and
where we had some fixed input values and also some variable
input value, and we also got some target values. So from
these things, we are tuning some parameters. So yes, it was that
data is good, but see now in the first session, it is not the
good place to discuss. Okay, so once we get into the algorithms,
when we take the feature engineering at the time, if you
show your data and to discuss real time. People will also
enjoy taking the data right, understanding those things,
because in the first session, only, if you are coming up or
problem statement something, people will be distracted and
everybody will get confused. Okay, yeah, okay,
yeah, I will give you the time at the time, according to the
require, I know that exactly where should we, you know, talk
about those things. I'll take up all those things. Okay, and
we're talking about the pipelines higher. Does it mean
same like CICD pipelines? Yes, we do that. Deployment, tripati.
We do the, you know, GitHub actions also. So no need to
worry about all those things. Thing is, like, you know, you
need to understand whatever I said here. If you understand
these things, your today's session is good to go. Okay,
Okay, done.
It was very interactive. I love the session, okay, I hope you
people also love the session, and I will be there for five
minutes. Whoever is completed their question answers they can
drop. I'll just for stay for five more minutes. If you have
still some questions, definitely, I'll take up the
questions. Okay, so now everybody is on the same page. I
hope so next tomorrow onwards, we are going to take in next
session. Okay, so
thanks everyone. Thanks for your patience and listening
patiently. Okay, thank you.
Great. Just publish any reference links are there? Thank
you? Yeah, definitely. I'll give that. Okay, not now. Let us take
once two sessions are done, I'll give you all the advanced
material. Okay, thanks, Sai Krishna, for the compliment.
Thank you very much. Can
you please share your.
Letters have given that right? Habib, dot v at talent spin
right
if it's in the chart, probably it should be helpful for us to
copy paste. Oh, God, in the chat. Is there any second
session coming in.
There any second session? Post lunch today, yes, after Yeah,
after two, you have another one, Raju or somebody else can jump
in and they will guide you. Okay,
you Yeah. Thanks everyone. Thank you for your you know, great
comments. It is something like, you know, which makes you more
energy and give you more okay. Thank you for your patience.
This is Jaipal. No understand today's session first, I have to
go the pre session classes or
your PPT is enough to people, PPT is enough, and this one,
this one is enough. Okay, this whiteboard is also enough,
right? If you feel it is not like Doctor handwriting, if you
can understand, I will share this. Okay, yeah, please share
this notes. Answer, yeah, sure. I'll do that. Don't worry. Okay,
okay, okay, take care. Everyone. Catch up tomorrow, same time.
Any prerequisites I should be doing? Post lunch tomorrow,
we'll get that key show Okay. Tomorrow, we'll get into the
check for understanding, check for preparation. Is there,
right? The FB can read it and you can come in. No problem. Do
we even some balance brain support team? We just have some
questions on the tests that we have to go through, sure, sure
after in the break, you know, afternoon you will be having, so
they will support you. Definitely. Okay.
Thank you, sir.
Could you please explain second? What time
again? Second, second of session. Raju. Raju, anybody is
there?
Tss family. Raju, here. Raju, take up the questions. Okay,
about the second session? Okay, okay,
okay, everyone. Take care. Bye. Catch up tomorrow. Thank you.
Thank you, sir, thank you.
What is your question? Can you come again?
Second half session?
What will be start and link? The
same link you can join
virtual classroom is a right in the LMS portal. Okay.
Using that link only, you can join only for the assignment
session where you have to use that group A, group B, group B
links are there right
for lab session. We have to use the links. That's it. The
remaining normal lectures
you should join by using virtual classroom.
Raju, yeah, this lab sessions, also, it's like, combined for
group A, group B, the mentors, no no for this week, we are
trying, like,
how did we, how we did, like, last weeks, like, group A, group
B, okay, please do separately, because it is a huge crowd, but
maybe mesh up for everyone to understand and ask doubts. Yeah,
okay.
And is it? Is it a lab session today?
Afternoon is like that extra session, like the CS theory
concepts on Python program,
could you speak to the CP, TFP, CF, you test the deadlines for
those and the quiz one that has been posted in the AIML this
thing in terms of the deadline and what exactly it says
ungraded? Not sure I understand what that means. Yeah,
ingredients like that these first two weeks will be like
under ungraded assessments only. These grades will not be
included in your main grades. Why? Because you have to
habituate these tests for
for these two weeks. So that's we are not including these
grades into your main grades. So from third week onwards, the
graded assessments will start.
The session will start at two o'clock and at four o'clock, and
this and this grade the assessments, we have to complete
it by tomorrow morning. And I see that it is not categorized
as group a groupie, but when I click on the course, I see that
there is a weekly assessment upgraded me activities. That is
common for all. There is no categorized by group, a group A
so can we have to complete this one in this complete in the in
this week, right? Not exactly for tomorrow morning. Actually,
this CRP is there, right? CRP will start from today, 9pm to
tomorrow, 9am
okay and see Cfu that will activate tomorrow, every Sunday,
1pm to 3pm
but can, can it not be extended because 1pm to 3pm is two.
Shorter time, and can it not be extended till the next day
morning? Yeah, in that we have only four questions.
Again, two from two. We will be in lab session, right? So it's
ideally, it is like just you are giving one hour time, 1pm to 2pm
one to 1pm to 3pm
No
telling it is 1pm to 3pm Raju, but the point is, from 2pm
everybody will be in the lab session. So will it be okay
after
lab session? If you can extend it after lab session, that will
be good, right? Only, actually two hours window. That's why I'm
telling you, after lab session from six to eight like that, I
will suggest
should be better, yeah,
yeah, 123, can be shifted to maybe no, six to nine or
whatever. Why is it only two hours general
exam? That's why they are
trying to this exam is done only that
the pre reading and the readme material is arrived on that
material only actually, that's that was my next question. What
is this based on when you say C F, P and C,
F, U, like, what's the reading material that we are supposed to
cover to be able to take this exam? Like, yes, yeah, one week
before, we are providing this pre reading and read me
material. Right before that, you have to go through that reading
material and you have to attend this test. So is it like for the
entire month of April and May that we have taken the math
programming that test? We have to cover all that for this test,
no only for this module. So the pre reading, okay, so the pre
reading that has been provided like on Monday, for today's
session, we need to cover that, and then we can attempt the
test. Yes, first to the Cfu and CFP, and the weekly test is
there at quiz one. Yeah, like quiz one, it will be a one week
window. It will start from Sunday,
okay, 6pm to next, Saturday, 9am
okay, so, and that is also on the material that has been
taught to us during the classes. Yeah, that is based on today,
just to be app and the lecture, right? Okay, so just just repeat
reiterating CP, C F, P and C F, U, F, you are based on the
reading material provided on Monday, and they are from 9am to
999,
pm to 9am for C Fu, CFP, and Cfu is six 1pm 1pm to 3pm and quiz
is 6pm to next Saturday. Okay, 9am
okay,
thank you. Yeah, yeah, and I'll shift, I will check with the
team, and I'll shift this Cfu that 1pm to 3pm I'll ship that
exam from 1pm to evening. There should be better. There should
be better.
Yeah, six to eight or six to nine. I'll, I'll change the day.
I'll change the
time. So not graded. Tomorrow is not graded,
right? These first two weeks are not not graded. It's not a
problem, so if we fail, also no problem, right? No problem. But
strongly recommend to take the test. Okay, just
question, why would the first test start at 9pm Why couldn't
it be opened a little earlier? Because you'd have to wait until
9pm in the night, start the test for us until 9am CFP,
PFP, not 9pm to 9am you're telling? Okay, yeah. Why? Why?
I'm just trying to understand, why that late? Are you trying to
give it? Yes, I am. I am also new to this mini ah, recently I
worked with another program. This cohort 25 is new to me.
AIML, so I am following the previous cohorts timings only.
No problem. Just, I'll, I'll, I'll propose the new timings
with the team. Then if they are okay, then I'll change so 6pm to
9am like the times, yeah. The reason I'm asking is, does it
have to be 12 hour window, or it could be like because we'll have
other things at 9pm right
earlier, it'd be easier for us to manage it in our time, day
time,
we can start at 6pm the CFT, that is a check for preparation.
You can open the window from 6pm in the evening to ending next
day for the
Cfu. That is a check for understanding
NPM after the main classes, and take it forward till and shift
it to right for.
From 1pm to, let's say, 9pm or the next day morning
again, 18 hours window here. Okay, okay, I'll, I'll, I'll
check with the team. I started at the time, the same time the
test will start, both the test will start. So at 6pm that Cfu
CFP will start, and the end time will different.
You can do this for us.
Alright, from next week onwards, just I'll change
for this one, Raju and Aish. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so for people
who are abroad, right, like the UK and US, so if the test
timings are like this, how can, how can they attempt, within the
time frame which you are proposing,
take up the lead on that? Hello, yeah, I can understand, I think
the 6pm to 9am works better for both, for
both the countries, or in any of the time zones it might cover.
The 9am is not enough. I think the
duration of the test and the
time period, time frame in which the test is online, like it,
it's available. That has to be increased as well for
all the all the folks, including like India,
okay, okay, no problem. I'll look into it.
Raja, could you blank your
timings in the WhatsApp group or email link to everybody I
already shared in the official WhatsApp group. I yesterday,
also today, morning, also I shared the timings.
Can you please share your email ids Raju and Aish?
My ID is, I mean, you can, if you have anything, you can write
to AIML dot support. Lakshmi, I'm one of the participants like
you. Just was trying to summarize so that there is no
confusion.
Okay,
just, if you have anything, just write to me that like AIML, dot
support at the talentsman.com, I'll receive that email and I'll
respond back. Raja, I have a question like tomorrow, thank
you available. So are these sessions will be recorded and
shared, because tomorrow you have a personal emergency like
hospitalization. Yes, every session will be recorded, and it
will be uploaded to your LMS within 48 hours. Afternoon. Lab,
if I miss that student also will be recorded.
Thank you.
Okay,
lab, we need to log into this session. Only, right, that
virtual session, only right from there you will take to the lab.
Is it? Yes? Yes, yes. The same that earlier, we used to do that
group A, group B, right? Module Zero, that group P and Sesha,
they took the session like that. Only you have to join as a batch
wise, I mean group wise, group A, group B, in that the mentors
will join, and they'll take the walk through. Then after, if we
have any doubts, then we will open the breakout rooms.
Okay, breakout room, then you will be that you guys will split
into some particular rooms. Okay,
oh, done by that. Supporters, right? Who will join? Yes, yes.
We will only split the rooms. Then you have to join that room
in that every mentor, each one particular particular mentor,
will join in that particular breakout room. Then if you have
any questions related to your assessment, I mean that lab
assignment, or any lecture, lecture things in that room you
can ask, then you can create as a first meeting joining. So we
have to join that group A or group whichever is applicable,
right? Yes, yes, thank you.
So today we will join us, group A, group B, or we'll join
today, then the common only the virtual
classroom. If you, if you have any doubt, just go through the
calendar. We have updated the details in the calendar,
program, calendar, okay, CFP
and Cfu Are they based on the lab session? Also, it is based
primarily on the the main content, which is from morning,
nine to afternoon, 1pm
No, no. The Cfu and CFP are related to that pre reading,
which we shared on Monday. Okay, okay, fair enough. The lab
systems are not figuring out in these tests.
What would you use the virtual launch for in the future?
Virtual launch like, if you guys have any doubts,
you can.
Directly join there, and you people can discuss,
okay, it's for us to discuss. Yes, yes. Anyway, going, we
will, I mean, divide into groups like 10 members. Are five
members in each group.
If you discuss your group in one place, that is the place you can
join virtual and you can discuss
okay question,
yeah, yeah, if both the
test information that pre reading material. So why subject
to test?
Hello,
hello. I am someone from the same team.
CFP is related to check for preparation, which is related to
your readme documents and everything. Cfu is something
which is a check for understanding which will happen
after the lecture of Sunday. Okay, so this takes like your
Saturdays lecture and Sunday's lecture.
Cfu is actually dependent on the lectures and not on the reading
materials. CFP, yeah, yeah. CFP is the one which only
understand the meaning check for preparation. What are the
reading materials you have read? Those questions will be coming.
For Understanding is nothing, but it comes with lecture of
Sunday lecture. So this quiz is happening after Sunday lecture.
Right?
Topics included in Sunday lecture and Saturdays lecture as
well comes like more practical
way,
practical. We'll have articles in that. So you need to eat some
articles and answer some questions
in that. Are you still speaking about CF here? No, I'm saying
about weekly test. Weekly test, which is a quiz. You mean? Okay?
Yeah, quiz.
Oh, okay, so understanding, and then practically implementation,
or like scenarios of that, it's
exams. But what about this weekly test? One is also a quiz,
or
it's also quiz like
questions.
You'll have five questions in CF and CFP, you have four
questions.
Raju, can you please mute yourself because of backgrounds
on because of that whatever
does? Yeah.
Can we have a describe pattern how exactly that each test will
be there and what basis comes into the picture? What are the
topics on general?
Yeah, I think you will have that we will share with you.
So we just had a discussion with Raju regarding the timings. Is
that something that is going to be applicable to this week, or
is it going to be something that you will come back to us?
Because lot of people had a questions about the time zones
and the availability, yeah, timings. Also, I'm not sure
about timings.
Usually for the last batch I was there. So in the last batch, we
usually have timings like
eight to 8am to 9am before the Sunday lecture. Okay, so while
we have only one hour
slot is like, it takes on 15 minutes of time to attempt four
questions. You have only some certain time to take that you're
talking about, CPF, right? CFP and Cfu.
Okay, I think this furthest back, the timings have been
changed. Raju will confirm you that in your Whatsapp group.
I mean, it's not about the 15 minutes, actually, it's about
our availability. It's, it's like your C, F, P, which is
appropriate. I'm just going to say preparator. Preparation one
is actually 9pm which I think is 9pm to 9am like, really are
times for us to work on them whenever in India. And then the
understanding one should actually give us a little bit of
time after the labs. Right now, it's overlapping with the
individual lab or another, probably class in the future. I
don't know what has been overlap with. And, yeah, we understand
that. And also the it's just one is 12 hour window. Another one
is two hour window. It's just that is for us. It matters the
availability, rather than the time it takes for us to take the
test.
So okay, yeah,
yeah, right now the Cfu and the individual lab tests on Sunday
are overlapping. So one is the Cfu is from one to three, and
then individual lab is from two to six. So I.
Uh, yes, yes, yeah, we understood that there's a
concern in it. We will look into it, and Raj will communicate to
you Whatsapp group, or an email will be coming.
And what is the cut off to take the weekly test, start it at the
stages, 6pm onwards. And then what is the cut off?
Cut out like it's not like only for This Week quiz, okay, which
like
whole, whole program, they will take some average from it.
No, sorry, what I'm not I'm what I'm saying is that, for example,
if, if 11th, you have the weekly test starts, I can take it from
6pm then we, what you're saying is, then it can be taken till
17th of May, 9am
so one week, yeah, we can test, yeah, if it starts at this
Sunday, it will end up next Sunday,
weekly test.
And then how do we stop go down the scoring, like every week we
take this exam. So then how the scoring
is being driven? I June
scoring.
So let's
say, every week we give the exams, right? So then, how does
it I mean, let's say, is it you to pass in all the all these
exams, each of them? Or, how will it be? It's not like
fast or or something in this weekly test, CFP, Cfu. So what
they'll do is that they'll take all the CFP from first week to
last week, just like last week, in a sense, the last module or
the end of the program. They'll take average from that.
It's a best of something like that.
And what's the passing then it is 60% 70% 80% what's the
passing score?
This correct thing. I need to
have not seen this the calculations previously. You'll
you'll get a communication regarding that,
yeah, if you can have a detail on, you know, how we are going
to be, how this, you know, entire process works like this,
examine exams, and then the passing scores, I think, and I'm
sure the attendance will also play in some criteria. So, and
then, what's the criteria on that?
The certification criteria is very important for us. Telling
people we are brief understanding
is
also asking we need, what? What's a attendance criteria?
What is the best passing criteria at the end during the
certification, during various saving certification, we don't
want to have any surfaces.
You want to know it. Sati, what will be beneficial is can, like
aim team, we can have just a half an hour session sometimes
next week to elaborate on all these topics as to, you know,
how we the scoring examinations,
the attendance. And then I think there are two parts this exam. I
think one is the six months thing. Then there's another
extended three months thing. So how does that translates to, and
what it it means from us and what it takes from us to, you
know, get through those if you can have a half an hour session,
I think all these questions will be put to rest. And I think
we'll we all will be bothering you guys even less. So can we
have that?
Yeah, understood. So in LMS platform, you will have academic
guidelines. So I think that is not yet, that link is not been
activated yet. So once the link is activated, you will have a
PDF format which tells you all the
attendance how the attendances has been taken and so how the
marks have been added, all those things. So once it is there,
available to you, you will
get all these thoughts cleared.
Okay, so you guys will let us know once that's published. Yes,
yes. But still, I would say that, you know, and people will
have questions. So probably, yeah, we are, we are here.
Yeah, publish it on Monday. We get a time to read it over the
over the week, and then any day, post that, you know, week, the
week after the weekend, after that week where you have
published, if you can have half last session to clarify the
doubts, I think that will be, for example, someone like mayo,
you has timing concerns and all, I think so those will all be, I
think, are addressed anywhere in one call.
Yeah, so timings and everything, some things, if you're you can
just try to drop mail to AIML, dot support. If something's
there, we are
there, and we can as a team, we are sharing here, right? Is a
male, really specific thing, but as a team, I think all the
students were attended here, we are all on same page, right?
Yeah.
Question is to make it available a common timing,
yeah,
yes, yes,
yeah. One more thing, like, as you said, the template, pattern
and everything for CP, CFP and Cfu is already uploaded. Where
it is, has been uploaded. And can, can we know that? How
exactly that it will be contents of it and everything.
So if you open the LMS, you will see that programming, Math
Foundations and classification algorithms.
So if you click on that, you can see,
sorry, actually, most of the people are following assessment
tracker, don't follow that assessment
tracker. Just you can see in the assessment tracker, did you
submit it or not? Did you create it for the particular assignment
or not just file while you click on that assign? I mean quiz one
or any CFP test hyperlink, it is redirected into other page, sign
in again, like that. It is showing, don't click on that.
Just follow the instruction. Sumanth is telling, no, just
follow. It will be under courses only.
Okay.
Now time,
one more question. What I have is like, if I there are two
which I understood, like Cfu and CFP, okay,
see Cfu and CFP. If the if I have to take the test of Cfu,
what should I learn before to take this test?
CF is for check for understanding, which means so it
will be based upon Saturday's lecture and Sunday's lecture.
Okay, okay,
CFP means CFP is check for preparation. So before
commencing of this lectures, you will have be shared some reading
materials, some two to three months of videos. So you need to
see them, and you need to read them. So the questions will be
coming from there. Okay. Quiz means, so
this weekly quiz is something which, like, you will have
two to three practical questions, or two or one
article questions, which means, like, you'll have an article
link over there, you need to click on that link. Need to read
like the whole Article. Article is something which like blogs,
so you need to read, read the blog, and the question will be
from that blog. Okay,
okay, one question. We have one week time. And so that you have
a week time, one week time, okay, if I start that exam, and
in between I have some work, and I pass that exam and go away and
again, come back. It will start again or better I stop, it will
continue from that point. No, I don't think so. It will happen
like that. Once you stop, it might be submitted. Is that it
like Raju
for a weekly test. They can do like that, but Cfu and Cfu there
will be a time, 20 minutes of time.
Also automatically, it will submit once a time
quiz, it is there. Right for quiz, it is there, yeah, all of
them are single attempt, No, we cannot do multiple attempts.
Hello, sorry, and all of them are single attempt. We cannot do
multiple Yes, only one. Yeah. Hi Raju, I have clicked on the test
