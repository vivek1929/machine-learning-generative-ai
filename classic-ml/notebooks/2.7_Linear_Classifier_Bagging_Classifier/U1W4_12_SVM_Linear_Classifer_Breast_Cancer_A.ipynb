Currently, the average risk of a woman in the United States developing breast cancer sometime in her life is about 13%, which means there is a 1 in 8 chance she will develop breast cancer!. An early diagnosis of BC can greatly improve the prognosis and chance of survival for patients. Thus an accurate identification of malignant tumors is of paramount importance."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"P677A-Xb0ONT"},"source":["#### Description\n","\n","The Breast cancer Data Set consists of 569 data instances.
